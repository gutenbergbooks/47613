<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br />The Mystery Hunters</h2>
<p>The High School at Cloverfield was quiet as the
hands of the clock approached the three-o&rsquo;clock
hour. Then a gong pealed out and the building became
a very beehive of sound. The thump of many
feet and the hum of voices was heard. Healthy,
wholesome young boys and girls poured out of the
side doors and swarmed over the campus. Overcoats
were pulled tighter as the nip of the keen
Vermont air was encountered.</p>
<p>Two boys had come out together, and they
paused to wait for two others. The boy with the
clean-cut, manly face and the sparkling eyes was
Barry Garrison, an outstanding boy in the Cloverfield
High School. He had been the right halfback
on the school team this year and had helped to lead
it to a glorious record of no defeats and first place
on the Conference list. He was an all-around athlete
and stood well in his senior-year studies. Although
Barry Garrison would have turned the idea
aside with a good-natured laugh, he was the most
popular boy in the high school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>His lifelong chum was Kent Marple. Kent&rsquo;s
father owned the local hotel, and the boy had enjoyed
many advantages in life. He and Barry had
been friends ever since they had been small boys.
Young Marple was broader than Barry, with a
heavy shock of black hair and a chin that was a
trifle determined. He had played fullback on the
football team during the past season.</p>
<p>These two boys did not seem to be in any hurry.
Barry leaned against a maple tree and whistled
softly, while Kent glanced from one side door of
the school to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The twins must have been kept in,&rdquo; Barry observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they are clapping erasers for the
teacher,&rdquo; Kent grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are, they&rsquo;ll clap &rsquo;em clean,&rdquo; Barry
laughed. &ldquo;The Ford twins always finish what they
start. Here they come now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Two boys came springing down the steps of the
school building and looked around for Barry and
Kent. When they had seen their particular friends,
one of them waved, and then both boys dashed
across the hard ground toward the boys under the
trees. At first glance there was little to distinguish
between Mac and Tim Ford. They were both the
same height and build, stocky young fellows who
had made splendid ends on the team. But at closer
range some differences were apparent. Mac was
sandy-haired, and Tim was gifted with a light
brown mass of hair that sometimes managed to stay
combed. Both boys had attractive, lively countenances
and were well liked by everyone in the
small town. They were often the leaders in the fun
and could always be counted on to join in any kind
of a lark. With Kent and Barry, they made up a
quartet that was widely known.</p>
<p>Mac Ford beat his brother to the maple tree by
a yard. &ldquo;Thought we never would get out,&rdquo; he
panted. &ldquo;Took Tim&rsquo;s advice in a problem, and it
was wrong. Had to do it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is that you <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> take my advice,&rdquo;
Tim denied. &ldquo;I tried to show you how to work it,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Barry interposed, thrusting his
hands deep into his sweater pockets. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move
along. It&rsquo;s cold today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be,&rdquo; Kent observed. &ldquo;Christmas is
almost here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two high-school boys and a girl passed them and
nodded and smiled. &ldquo;There they go,&rdquo; the girl cried.
&ldquo;The mystery hunters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four Sherlocks, the locker-room detectives!&rdquo;
chimed in one of the boys. When this trio had
passed on, the four chums looked at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to keep calling us the mystery hunters,&rdquo;
Barry smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because we found out who was stealing
things out of the lockers,&rdquo; grunted Tim. &ldquo;That
wasn&rsquo;t such a big job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody could have done it, if he had taken
the trouble to,&rdquo; Kent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest surprise about the whole thing was
the fact that a boy like Carter Wolf was doing it,&rdquo;
Mac put in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Proceeding slowly along the sidewalk toward
home, the four boys once more discussed the recent
events which had resulted in earning the name
of &ldquo;mystery hunters.&rdquo; For a long time someone had
been stealing athletic supplies and even rings and
watches from the gymnasium locker room. Persistent
efforts had been made to trap the thief, but
without success. Finally the four boys had entered
the case, chiefly because a birthday ring of Mac&rsquo;s
had been among the things taken. But for a long
time they had not made any progress. The prowler
seemed to know exactly what they were about. They
even tried sleeping in the locker room, but even
this produced no results. Finally they decided on
strategy and rigged up a camera. This was placed
in another room, at a place in the wall where a
single brick had been knocked out. The locker
doors were hooked up in such a way that when one
of them was opened, the camera would operate.</p>
<p>They got immediate results with this. And on
the day they took the camera down, a certain
wealthy boy named Carter Wolf left school. The
negative, when developed, showed that Carter
Wolf was the guilty one. His startled face was
turned toward the camera, whose click he had
heard, and one hand was plainly seen opening a
locker door. At first he denied the charges, but
finally he had made good the losses in one way or
another. Mac was lucky enough to get his ring
back, but others found that their property had been
sold to pay gambling debts that Wolf had contracted.
Only the influence and pleading of his
father had saved the boy from the punishment he
richly deserved. For the time being he had disappeared
from the community, but not until he had
left a threat behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even scores with that Barry Garrison
bunch,&rdquo; he had promised.</p>
<p>With the identification of the mysterious sneak
thief a wave of relief had swept over Cloverfield
High School. The teachers and students were
grateful to the four boys whose persistence had
finally caught the prowler. The good-natured title
of &ldquo;mystery hunters&rdquo; had been given them, and the
boys knew that under it lay a genuine admiration
for the piece of work that they had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you figure it all out,&rdquo; Kent declared, as
they stopped a moment before the brownstone
house in which Barry lived, &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t much to
it. Maybe there would be a different story if we
ever ran up against a real mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysteries are few and far between,&rdquo; Tim said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about something more vital. We&rsquo;ll have
about ten days of vacation at Christmas time.
What&rsquo;ll we do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat popcorn and candy off the Christmas tree,&rdquo;
Mac grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our tree won&rsquo;t have enough on to keep us eating
very long,&rdquo; Tim answered. &ldquo;Shall we do a little
winter camping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that or hunt some,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
give it some thought in the next few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boys went on down the street, while
Barry turned in at the door of the brownstone
house. Kent lived two doors beyond, and the twins
lived around the corner in a big frame house. The
Fords were not among the wealthiest people in the
town, although Mr. Ford did have a fairly good
business in dry goods. But they were a fine family,
and Kent and Barry had been fond of the two
lively boys since grammar-school days.</p>
<p>As Barry entered the hall, his sister Pearl was
going up the stairs. In the library to the right of
him he could see his father, seated under a lamp,
reading a magazine. The rattling of a pan on the
stove told him where his mother was.</p>
<p>Pearl was in her first year of high school and
had preceded him home by several minutes. She
paused a moment on the upper landing to address
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the chief of the mystery hunters!&rdquo; she
called cheerfully. &ldquo;Do you know that everybody is
calling you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;I wish they would
forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Garrison looked up from his magazine. &ldquo;I
need some real mystery hunters right now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;If you want to take on a real puzzler, come
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry was at once interested. His father was a
lawyer and frequently handled important cases.
The boy placed his books on a hall table and
walked into the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, Dad? What mystery are you
talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Garrison took off his glasses and wiped his
eyes. &ldquo;I was thinking about that haunted hunting
lodge up on Lake Arrowtip,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I was
only joking when I told you to come ahead. It is a
job that will test the brains of an expert detective.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br />The Story of the Haunted Lodge</h2>
<p>Barry sat down in one of the big chairs and faced
his father. Mr. Garrison had put his magazine
aside and was looking thoughtfully at his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A haunted lodge, Dad? Where is it? What
haunts it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer laughed. &ldquo;One question at a time,
son! I knew that you would want to know about it
as soon as I mentioned that it was haunted, or supposed
to be haunted. Because of course it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what makes people say that it is? Tell me
something about it, Dad. Where is it located on
Lake Arrowtip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right about the middle of the lake, on a high
bluff that commands a magnificent view up and
down the big sheet of water. It is the hunting lodge
that belongs to Mrs. Morganson, one of my clients.
Some years ago she had that fine big lodge built
and used to go up there once in a while herself,
though she hasn&rsquo;t been there in late years. You
know Lake Arrowtip fairly well, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve hiked and camped up there with Kent
and the twins. I think I know where that lodge is.
Isn&rsquo;t it a big log house with a porch looking out
over the lake, off in the direction of Rake Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the place. Ever been in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we&rsquo;ve passed it in a canoe. There was
a party at the lodge at the time. There is another
cabin close by, a small log building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the Bronson cabin. It is owned by a
retired lawyer friend of mine, and he never uses it
any more. It is very close to the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell me about this mystery, Dad. Do the
people around there think the place is haunted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t very many people around there to
think that, but some of our town people won&rsquo;t go
to the place. I suppose you remember that Mrs.
Morganson&rsquo;s nephew disappeared up there over a
year ago and has never been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry slung one leg over the arm of the chair.
&ldquo;I do remember hearing something about that,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he kidnaped and carried off to
Canada somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed so,&rdquo; his father nodded. &ldquo;There was
one letter from Canada, telling his aunt not to
worry, that he was being well treated. But no trace
of him has ever been discovered, and some splendid
detectives have been looking for Felix Morganson.
Well, since the time that he disappeared,
things haven&rsquo;t been going well at Bluff Lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that when the haunting began?&rdquo; Barry
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little later than that. You see, Felix Morganson
disappeared during a Thanksgiving party at
the lodge. There was quite a crowd at the lodge,
and they were enjoying a gathering at the time.
Along about ten o&rsquo;clock or so at night Mr. Morganson
walked out of the place smoking a cigarette.
Several saw him go, but no one asked him where
or why he was going. As time went on they missed
him, and finally some of the men walked out on the
bluff which overlooks the lake, following his footsteps
in the light snow that had fallen. Close to the
edge of the bluff they found the snow kicked and
scuffed up and his cigarette only partially smoked.
Then there were long, dragging marks in the snow
that seemed to indicate that he had been pulled
along down the path to the lake. All trace of him
was lost at that point, because the lake was frozen
over and the ice was as smooth as glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Barry was absorbed in the story. &ldquo;No one in the
lodge heard anything? No outcry or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father shook his head. &ldquo;No. But that same
night a servant, a Frenchman, disappeared. He was
a man that had been hired to cook and to wait on
the tables, and this man was gone. No one knows
whether he had anything to do with it all or not,
but he left the lodge about the same time Felix
Morganson did. No trace of him was ever found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long after the disappearance of Mr. Morganson
before they heard from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a month later. Then a hastily scrawled
letter came from a little town in Canada, telling
his aunt that he was well and not to worry. He
stated that he did not have time to write any more
at the moment. Of course the detectives hustled up
to that town, but so far have been unable to learn
anything or to uncover a single clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been missing well over a year now,
hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Barry mused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because Thanksgiving was three weeks
ago, and it was at that time that he vanished. The
queer part about it all is the fact that no request
for a ransom was ever received. Mrs. Morganson is
quite wealthy, and a considerable sum could be
raised among the friends of Felix. But there has
never been any demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo; Barry slumped lower in the chair,
his mind busy with the details of the event. &ldquo;But
how about this haunting that you spoke of? That
came later, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three months after Felix Morganson disappeared,&rdquo;
Mr. Garrison answered. &ldquo;Besides going
up there herself once in a while, Mrs. Morganson
also rents the place out to sportsmen who go up
for the winter season to hunt, and to those that go
there in the summer to fish. Well, late in January
a group of sportsmen went there, and the understanding
was that they would stay about three
weeks. But at the end of one week they gave it up
and took a smaller place down at the tip of the
lake. They complained of ghostly rappings, or
knocks on the door and no one there when they
opened, and they also complained that some of
their things had been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds foolish,&rdquo; Barry said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thought it was, at first. You see, I handle
all of Mrs. Morganson&rsquo;s business, and I had rented
the place to these men, who came from Connecticut.
We thought for a while that they were just
cranky and let it go at that. But two weeks later another
party went in, and it was the same thing over
again. Added to that, one of the men had an expensive
fur coat stolen, and he wanted to bring suit
against us. It seems that they heard about the experience
of the former party and claimed that we
had rented the lodge to them under false pretenses.
We had some trouble getting out of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be just some ordinary thief that lives in
the woods near there,&rdquo; Barry ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, he goes around annoying everybody that
puts up in the lodge. Later in the year some fishermen
took over the place, and they had similar experiences,
and, besides all that, they found their
fishing boat scuttled one morning, three holes
bored in it. Fortunately we had told them the reputation
that the place was getting, but they had just
laughed at it. They came away mad as hornets.
Well, you can see what it is all doing. No one will
rent the lodge now, and it had a long list of prospective
renters once. The value of it keeps going
down, and since we cannot rent or sell it at a decent
price, it is standing idle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mrs. Morganson want to sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does now. We have both become so tired
of the place and its problem that we would like
nothing better than to get it off our hands. There is
only one buyer at present, a man named Brand
Curry, but he wants it at a price so low that we
won&rsquo;t even discuss it. The man never comes to me,
he always goes directly to Mrs. Morganson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Dad, did you ever have a detective
on the case? Ever have any one go up
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I have had two private investigators
spend some time on the case. One of them didn&rsquo;t
find anything or have any kind of an experience.
But the other man did. He was a big, chunky fellow
named Riley, and he said he could catch anything
he went after. Said he would come home
dragging the ghost or spook, or whatever it was, by
the neck. He remained there two days and then came
back and resigned from the case. The first night
he was kept busy investigating thumps all over
the place, and the second night his shoes and shirt
were mysteriously whisked away somehow and he
was in a fix because he hadn&rsquo;t taken any baggage
with him. He had to go to Fox Point and outfit
himself there, and he had to go down there without
shirt or shoes. He didn&rsquo;t hear anything that
night, and all the time he was there he didn&rsquo;t see
anything. He was a disgusted man when he came
back here, and it was his opinion that the National
Guard should be ordered up there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Barry and his father laughed at the plight of the
private detective who had been so sure of victory
over the haunting presence at Bluff Lodge. &ldquo;But
of course, Dad, you believe that someone is doing
all this for a purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any other explanation,&rdquo; his father
confessed. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t figure out any reason for it.
Why should anyone want to frighten camping parties
that way? And who is clever enough to make
raps and groans and knocks and yet disappear before
anyone can spot him? That lodge stands pretty
well out of the trees, and no one could dodge behind
some convenient tree trunk after every one of
these meaningless pranks. As for the disappearance
of Mr. Riley&rsquo;s shirt and shoes, that isn&rsquo;t so much of
a mystery, after all. The window was open in his
room, and anyone could have fished the clothing
out. He is lucky that they didn&rsquo;t steal anything
more and put him in a bad position.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is one thing that convinces me that the
spook is a clever one,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;An amateur or
a plain fun maker would have stolen all of his
things. This one took just enough to create an air
of mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kindly face of Mrs. Garrison appeared in
the doorway. &ldquo;Supper is ready,&rdquo; she smiled. Barry
and his father walked out of the room together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; said Barry, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a real mystery. I&rsquo;d
like nothing better than to go up there with some
of the boys and nose around a bit. Maybe we could
find out something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father smiled and slapped him on the back.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you taking that title of &lsquo;mystery hunter&rsquo;
a little seriously, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am, Dad, but you never can tell. I still
think our bunch could find out something of value.
Just try us and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br />Planning an Expedition</h2>
<p>Shortly after supper Barry Garrison left the
house and crossed the grass in the direction of
Kent&rsquo;s home. But he was saved the trouble of a
journey to his chum&rsquo;s house by the appearance of
Kent himself. He came dashing down the walk
and joined Barry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going for a walk?&rdquo; he hailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to Sadler&rsquo;s store and get my ice
skates,&rdquo; Barry replied. &ldquo;I left them there to be
sharpened. Thought you&rsquo;d like to go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to,&rdquo; nodded Kent, falling into step beside
him. &ldquo;I want to do some studying a little later, and,
after the supper I ate, I felt the need for a brisk
walk. I was going to drop in and see you for a second
before going back to the midnight oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to see you,&rdquo; Barry informed him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got quite an idea in my head for our winter
vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? A hunting trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not hunting animals. Hunting spooks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kent demanded. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said hunting spooks. Or ghosts or haunts or
something. Think we could take a photograph of
a rapping spook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; Kent
growled. &ldquo;It all sounds goofy to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry laughed. &ldquo;It did to me, when my father
was telling me about it. Tune in to the proper station
while I tell you something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tuned in,&rdquo; Kent said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to make
it a good one, or it will all be static. Let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two of them walked slowly toward the
business section of Cloverfield, Barry related the
story which he had heard from his father. Kent&rsquo;s
light and scornful attitude vanished as he listened,
and he soon became as deeply interested as Barry
had been. Their steps became slower, and they no
longer felt the coldness of the night air. They had
arrived outside the brightly lighted window of
the hardware store just as Barry finished, and they
lingered a moment to discuss it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a first-class mystery,&rdquo; Kent declared.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go up there and snoop around some.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I had in mind,&rdquo; Barry told
him. &ldquo;I talked about it with Dad at the supper
table, and he wasn&rsquo;t very keen about it at first, but
finally he said it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anything for us to
go up there and look around. He said he would try
and get permission for us to camp in the Bronson
cabin, which is in sight of the lodge. How does that
strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right on the bull&rsquo;s-eye,&rdquo; answered Kent,
promptly. &ldquo;We can hike up there in two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can skate up there in less time than that,&rdquo;
Barry said. &ldquo;The Buffalo River runs into the lake
about two miles below the cabin and the lodge, and
we could go that way. Even if we don&rsquo;t accomplish
a thing toward solving the mystery, we will at least
have a good vacation, taking in a skating trip and
camping in a cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing! We&rsquo;ve never camped in a cabin.
Say, look who is in the hardware store.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Following the direction of Kent&rsquo;s nod, Barry
glanced through the glass, and his eyes rested on
the form of a boy about their own age, who was
examining a sleeping bag. This young man was
well dressed and wore an expensive fur coat. On a
counter near by a pile of camping equipment lay
spread out. Barry recognized the boy at once. It
was Carter Wolf, the one who had been detected
stealing from the lockers at school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like Wolf is going somewhere,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to have a lot of duffle with him, too,&rdquo;
added Kent. &ldquo;This is the first time we&rsquo;ve seen him
since our affair of the locker room. Let&rsquo;s see if he
greets us with politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the store. There was only one
clerk in attendance, and he was busy with Carter
Wolf. Just as they closed the door they heard Wolf
purchase the sleeping bag. He saw the boys and
flushed slightly, but contented himself with merely
turning his back on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else, Mr. Wolf?&rdquo; the clerk asked.
Wolf consulted a list which he held in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one thing more,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I want a
lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk quickly procured one from stock.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re buying a lot of stuff, Mr. Wolf,&rdquo; he
smiled. &ldquo;Must be going on a camping trip somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf raised his voice slightly. &ldquo;I am. A bunch
of us are going up to camp on Lake Arrowtip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Barry and Kent exchanged glances and then
looked frankly at the goods which Wolf had purchased.
They were expensive things, and there was
no doubt that the rich boy was planning a real
winter camping trip. Fishing tackle and an ax for
ice fishing, an old stove, a rifle and several boxes of
shotgun shells, a hunting coat and cap, two pairs
of boots, the sleeping bags for two other members
of his party, and a handsome hunting knife. He
gave directions for having the goods sent to his
home and then left the store, ignoring the presence
of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder whom he is going camping with?&rdquo;
Kent asked, as they waited for the ice skates to be
wrapped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes with a crowd of fellows from Harrison,&rdquo;
Barry said. &ldquo;Probably they are the ones who
will go. He evidently intends to be right in our
territory, so we&rsquo;ll have to make room for one another.
I don&rsquo;t like him well enough to want to be
very near him or his crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo; Kent agreed. &ldquo;He could be a
nice fellow if he tried hard, but it is easier to be
the other way. Trouble with him is, his daddy has
always spoiled him. Well, we&rsquo;ll be in a cabin, so
we&rsquo;ll probably not conflict with one another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>They left the store and walked toward home,
still discussing the thing nearest their minds. Close
to Barry&rsquo;s house they met the twins, who were just
striding along under a lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some news for them that will open
their eyes,&rdquo; Kent chuckled.</p>
<p>The twins bore down on them. &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo;
Mac cried. &ldquo;Tell us all about the trip to Arrowtip
Lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Tim. &ldquo;When do we go up to
the haunted lodge and get busy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br />A Strange Conversation</h2>
<p>Barry and Kent surveyed the grinning Ford boys
for a moment in silence, &ldquo;the wind taken right out
of their sails,&rdquo; as Kent said afterwards. Then
Barry grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you fellows hear about that lodge?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be much trouble to answer,&rdquo; Kent
declared, before either of the boys could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been to your house, and Pearl told
Mac. Whatever you tell one of them, you tell the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac&rsquo;s only answer to the charge was a bland
grin which admitted nothing, but Barry knew that
Kent was right. His sister Pearl was an avowed
friend of Mac&rsquo;s, and the school chatter always
linked their names together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known it,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;Well, as
far as that goes, it wasn&rsquo;t any secret from you fellows,
but it mustn&rsquo;t get all over town. I&rsquo;ll warn
Pearl to keep it quiet. I suppose you&rsquo;ll want to go
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we!&rdquo; cried Tim. &ldquo;Try and leave us home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about skating up Buffalo
River to the lake?&rdquo; Kent asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Mac approved. &ldquo;There are a
couple of places where we&rsquo;ll have to leave the ice
and hike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Barry acknowledged. &ldquo;But we
can skate most of the way. How much of the story
did Pearl tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood under the street light in a group, and
the Ford boys told what they had learned. Pearl
knew most of the events that had taken place at
Bluff Lodge, and with only a few details Barry
completed the story. All the boys were now more
eager than ever before to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep the mystery part a secret,&rdquo; Kent
urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll simply give out the information that
we are going on a Christmas-vacation camping
trip. That is partly true and is as much as anyone
else needs to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll run afoul of Wolf and his
bunch?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; was Barry&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t let them worry us if we do see them. Well, I
want to get on home and do a little studying. Are
you twins through with yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It developed that the twins had simply gone out
for a walk after their evening meal and had
dropped in first at Kent&rsquo;s and then at Barry&rsquo;s
home. It was the custom of the four boys to stroll
some after supper and then buckle down to their
studies. They all made fair grades in school, and
Kent was the outstanding one among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fellows going to win that soccer game
against Berkley?&rdquo; Kent asked the Fords, as they
lingered for a moment in front of Barry&rsquo;s door.
His question immediately plunged them into a discussion
concerning the soccer game, now only two
days off. Tim and Mac were on the team, but Kent
and Barry had cast in their lots with the gymnasium
group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>They finally separated, somewhat reluctant to
split up, as they were devoted friends, and the
study table was less to be desired than their companionship.
But as Mac expressed it, &ldquo;all good
things have to come to an end, even a plate of ice
cream!&rdquo; and with that the soccer players started
off on a sprint around the corner, while Barry and
Kent went to their front doors with less forceful
energy.</p>
<p>Two days later Cloverfield went to Berkley to
play soccer. The team had gone down earlier in
the day in a big bus, and the rooters followed in
cars and on the train. Barry and Kent decided to
go by rail, as it was a short trip and not too expensive,
so they caught the proper train and were soon
in the small town and on their way to the athletic
field.</p>
<p>The game was a stirring one, and the two boys
in the stand were gripped by it. The two teams
battled up and down the field fiercely, driving the
ball forward and being hurled back. It became so
exciting that Barry and Kent left the stand and
followed the teams from one end of the field to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too doggone cold to sit in the stand today, anyway,&rdquo;
Barry said.</p>
<p>Both teams were battling for a secure position
in the school conference, and victory today meant
something. The boys who had run out on the field
in the short trousers and thin, sleeveless jerseys
were now warm and glowing with the swift running
and kicking and blocking. It seemed as
though it must end in a scoreless tie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Mac and Tim had been battling to the limit.
Tim bore down on a Berkley kicker and leaped into
the air, blocking the sailing ball. Racing around
the almost spent player, Tim dashed into position
to kick the ball across the goal line. But the safety
man was facing him, ready to boot the football far
down the field and out of danger. Just then Tim
saw his brother cut loose and leave the tangled
group. Mac&rsquo;s voice reached him in husky pleading.</p>
<p>Tim kicked the ball across on an angle, and
Mac&rsquo;s toe met it with a mighty boot that abruptly
changed its course. Caught off guard, the goal
tender made a mad dive for the oncoming ball.
But he was a fraction too late, and the soccer ball
flashed across for the first goal and point.</p>
<p>Kent and Barry joined enthusiastically in the
wild cheer that went up from Cloverfield rooters.
In the next six minutes that remained, Berkley
fought fiercely to even the score, but Cloverfield
fought as grimly to turn them back and prevent
them from scoring. In this they were successful,
and the game ended with a victory in favor of the
visiting team by the score of one to nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great work that the twins did,&rdquo; approved
Barry, as they followed the crowd out of the stand
section.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; nodded Kent. &ldquo;That gives us
the edge on the championship. We&rsquo;ll congratulate
the boys when we see them at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found quite a crowd assembled at the station,
and their train was not due for some time.
There was a holiday spirit among the people, and
the station was decorated with wreaths and sprigs
of Christmas greens. Toys and candy were displayed
in one case. The stoves at each end of the
station glowed, and the heat felt good.</p>
<p>Kent and Barry joined a group of home school
boys and chatted. Presently Barry left the circle
and walked over to the counter to buy a newspaper.
Obtaining one, he glanced over the headlines
and then turned to the sport page. There
were some comments on games and players, and he
sat down on a high-backed station seat to read. On
the other side two men were seated and talking,
but Barry was too absorbed even to glance their
way. It was a chance phrase that caught his attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anything new on that Bluff Lodge deal?&rdquo; a
voice asked.</p>
<p>The voice that answered was coarse and husky.
&ldquo;No. The old lady don&rsquo;t want to accept my price.
But let her hold out if she wants to. The value
don&rsquo;t go up any. Not on that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Barry&rsquo;s eyes were still on the
print, but he did not see it. His ears were listening
keenly. It was possible that they were talking
about some other place than the haunted lodge.
The words of the first man came to him once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody will rent the place. She&rsquo;ll be ready to
give it away before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the train puffed into the station,
drowning out every other sound. Barry growled
inwardly. &ldquo;It would have to get in just at this moment!&rdquo;
Folding his paper, he stood up casually
and looked after the two men, who were walking
out to board the train. One was tall and thin, and
the other was short and chunky. He was unable to
see the face of either one clearly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder who those fellows are,&rdquo; he
mused. &ldquo;No doubt Dad will know them, if they
are connected in any way with Bluff Lodge. And
from the way they talked, they have an interest in
that place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br />The Start Upriver</h2>
<p>A few days after the victorious soccer game with
Berkley the high school closed for the Christmas
vacation. With whoops of joy the boys and girls
poured out of the institution of learning and
started home, eager for the holiday and all the
good things connected with it. A light snow had
fallen the night before, and the country was
clothed with a blanket of white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow night Tim will sit up and try to see
what Santa Claus looks like,&rdquo; Mac grinned, as the
four boys walked down the main street. &ldquo;He always
does, until Pa chases him to bed. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Tim cut his speech short by neatly planting a
hastily packed snowball back of Mac&rsquo;s ear. His
brother returned the fire, and finally Kent and
Barry joined in, the fun becoming fast and furious.
A group across the street began to bombard
them, and then the four chums turned on the common
enemy. In this manner, enjoying the sharp air
and the good-natured fun, the boys came to Barry&rsquo;s
door and stopped for a final word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we get started?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to light out on the morning
after Christmas,&rdquo; Barry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Kent objected. &ldquo;We
have to buy some provisions and pack our sled, and
we won&rsquo;t want to do that on Christmas. Let&rsquo;s make
it two days after the great holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed to this. &ldquo;As far as I can see,
nobody knows why we are going,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think everyone believes that we are just
going off on a camping trip,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;That is
what we want them to think. After all, we may not
learn a thing about the mystery, and in that case
our trip will be just a winter camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll work like the dickens to get a line on
the spook,&rdquo; promised Kent, as they parted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Christmas Day was cold and gray, and late in
the afternoon it began to snow. For several hours
the light flakes fell, and the boys were beginning
to worry. If the snow became too deep, their trip
would have to be put off, and it looked very much
as though the ice on the river would be covered
in such a way that skating would be impossible.
But the day following the holiday a wind blew the
snow into drifts and banks and Kent reported that
the river was clear enough to skate on.</p>
<p>Christmas Day passed off quietly, and the boys
enjoyed it. There were gifts and family gatherings
and a cheery air in general. The next day they
busied themselves, preparing to go on their trip.
In Kent&rsquo;s barn there was a wide, low sled, and they
began to pack it with supplies and food. Late in
the afternoon they stood in a group and surveyed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess everything is on there,&rdquo; Barry said
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything else,&rdquo; Kent admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is going to pull the sled at the start?&rdquo;
Tim asked, roping an ax down firmly.</p>
<p>Kent winked at Barry. &ldquo;Seems like you twins
ought to pull it all the way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are
both the same size and would show up well in harness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t look any better than you would,&rdquo;
Mac retorted. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s flip a coin to see who pulls
first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Several tosses of the coin indicated that Kent
was to pull the sled first, and the twins pounded
him on the back in derision. Darkness was now
falling fast, and they separated for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time are we starting?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get going at eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Barry decided.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any great hurry. We&rsquo;ll hunt a
little on the way up there and can camp out tomorrow
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the four boys, impatient to be on their way,
the night seemed a long one, but the day of the
start finally came and they were ready to go. Mr.
Garrison had a final word with Barry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the keys to the Bronson cabin, and
this one is for the lodge,&rdquo; he told his son, as the latter
laced up his high-top lumberman shoes. &ldquo;You
can look around all you want to, but keep out of
trouble. I&rsquo;d rather that you would not camp in the
lodge unless there seems to be some good reason
for doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;But it will be permissible
to look through the place, won&rsquo;t it, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely. I want you to go through the lodge,
but I think you&rsquo;ll be more comfortable in Bronson&rsquo;s
cabin. The lodge is a big, rambling place and
not easy to heat. Have a good time, and start back
in time for school again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry promised, and after bidding his family
good-bye he was off on a trot across the intervening
yards to Kent&rsquo;s barn. He found his companions
there, tying a few last minute articles fast. They
greeted him joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just going over to ask your mother if
you were up yet!&rdquo; Mac hailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have told you that I&rsquo;ve been up a
long time,&rdquo; Barry smiled.</p>
<p>Kent slung his skates over his shoulder. &ldquo;I guess
we&rsquo;re ready to go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d we decide had
to pull the sled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who,&rdquo; Tim answered. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be
any weight to pull when it gets on the ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mystery hunters set off for the Buffalo
River, which flowed close to the residential section
of Cloverfield. It was a clear, cold day, and their
spirits rose with each step forward. The sun
sparkled on the snowbanks and the icicles, until
all the landscape flashed with beauty. All four of
them rejoiced to be alive and able to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just feel like I could strike out and skate for
hours,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dandy day for a snow fight like we had at
the high school last year,&rdquo; Kent observed. &ldquo;In fact,
a fellow would feel like doing about anything on a
day like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except being at home with the mumps or
something,&rdquo; Tim chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the old river,&rdquo; Barry said, as they
came in sight of the Buffalo. &ldquo;Now we can get into
real action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat on a rotted log beside the river and put
on their skates. It was a cold job, and more than
once they paused to blow on chilled fingers. But at
last the skates were adjusted and the campers were
ready to swing up the river toward Lake Arrowtip.
They clumped down the side of the bank and
slid out on the ice, cutting a few circles by way
of warming up. Kent hooked the rope of the sled
to the belt of his Mackinaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re about ready,&rdquo; he nodded, and
with a ringing sound the runners of the skates slid
forward and they were away on their journey upriver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>For over a mile they kept up a fast pace and
then moderated it somewhat, settling down to an
even gait that would take them a long way from
home if maintained for any length of time. They
passed a few skaters and one group of high school
boys in particular, with whom they paused to chat.
From them they gleaned the information that Carter
Wolf and some of his friends had started on
their trip, going in a roundabout way by motor
truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find it a rough journey over any of
these roads to Lake Arrowtip,&rdquo; Barry commented,
as they resumed their skating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go this way or even to hike it,&rdquo; Kent
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Wolf would rather go the most comfortable
way,&rdquo; Mac observed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the truck
was heated in some way. I&rsquo;m even surprised that
Wolf will go camping in the winter time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Cloverfield far behind them, the boys
followed the little river into the deep woods. In
the forest the stream became narrower, but there
was room for all of them, and they had gone seven
miles before it became necessary to leave the ice
sheet and take to the shore. They came at last to a
place where a log was frozen broadside into the
ice and a mass of refuse spoiled the smooth, glassy
surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;First detour,&rdquo; sang out Barry. &ldquo;What do you
say we hike some and see if we can bring down a
rabbit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were agreeable, and they took to the
shore. The trees were sufficiently far back from
the banks to allow them to proceed. Pulling the
sled was harder, and Barry relieved Kent of it.
They tramped along, and just before noon Mac
took a shot at a squirrel, but missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bum shot,&rdquo; he exclaimed, in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t lament over that,&rdquo; Kent consoled.
&ldquo;It would be quite a job to bring that lightning
dodger down with a rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noontime they halted and made temporary
camp. The twins cut into the wet wood and hewed
to the center for the dry heart of it. The other two
boys scraped away the snow and piled some rocks
for a fireplace. After some fanning and blowing,
the damp wood caught fire and blazed up.</p>
<p>Kent searched among the articles on the sled and
then straightened up. &ldquo;Say, look here. Did anybody
think to bring coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The other three boys looked at one another
blankly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Barry admitted, and the twins
admitted the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can live without it,&rdquo; Mac pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we can, but you know how good it tastes
on a camping trip, especially in winter. We
haven&rsquo;t even got cocoa along. And I was sure that
the sled was fully packed! Is there any place that
we can get it along the line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could swing away from the river a little bit
and get it at Fox Point,&rdquo; Barry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that, then. I guess we can go without
it for a few days. Come on and get your plates
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The journey was resumed immediately after
dinner, and they skated for a few miles. Then some
rocks made it necessary for them to go around,
and they walked some more. Chancing to see an
old mill on a branch of the river, they explored it,
and before long nightfall was upon them and they
stopped to make an overnight camp. Two small
camping tents were set up and sleeping bags
spread out. Then they made a fireplace and gathered
a supply of wood. By the time that the fire
was going it was pitch dark, and the flames flashed
up into the inky blackness like living tongues,
throwing the black tree trunks into bold relief
against the white background of the snow-covered
earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows, this is just right!&rdquo; Tim exclaimed,
looking around him with delight. Barry and Kent
were bent over the fire, and Mac was coming in
with a load of wood on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s colder camping than we are used to,&rdquo; Kent
remarked.</p>
<p>Mac threw his load of wood on the ground.
&ldquo;Boys, we may be able to get some coffee,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There is another campfire just a short distance
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked up with interest. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
Barry and Kent asked in chorus.</p>
<p>Mac pointed in the direction from which he
had brought the wood. &ldquo;Just a little way over
there. I was chopping wood on the top of a knoll,
and I could see their fire through the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go over there and borrow some
coffee,&rdquo; Tim said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be nice to know who our neighbors
are,&rdquo; Barry commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said Kent, slowly, &ldquo;those neighbors
happen to be Carter Wolf and his particular
friends. If so, the less they know about our whereabouts,
the better for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br />Strange Treatment</h2>
<p>There was a moment of silence after Kent had
spoken. The boys were not afraid of the Wolf boy
and his companions, but they had no desire to
camp too close to them. Carter possessed a mean
spirit, and they felt it best to avoid him wherever
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly believe that they will camp out in the
woods,&rdquo; Tim said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they will go to a cabin
or some more comfortable place. If it is Wolf, he
won&rsquo;t give us any coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or sell us any, either,&rdquo; Mac added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t need to walk right into that other
camp,&rdquo; Barry advised. &ldquo;It ought to be easy to approach
the place without making any noise. I
think we should find out who is camping there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim and I will go over and scout around,&rdquo;
Mac offered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Barry nodded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get supper
ready. If anything goes wrong, just sing out and
we&rsquo;ll come hopping over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing will happen if we get running first,&rdquo;
Tim grinned. &ldquo;Shall we offer to pay for the
coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; nodded Kent. &ldquo;They may have a small
supply, and we wouldn&rsquo;t want to take it away from
them. If they give it to you, that will be all right,
but we should offer to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim pushed his camping ax down into his belt
case. &ldquo;Come on, Mac. Let&rsquo;s see where you spotted
that fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Barry and Kent at the campfire, the
two brothers hiked off into the woods to the knoll
where Mac had been cutting wood. It was an uphill
climb, and their breath showed in little, frosty
clouds before they got to the place. Finally Mac
pointed off through the spruce trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is. See that fire down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the direction of Mac&rsquo;s mittened finger,
Tim saw a small point of light down in a hollow.
It came evidently from a small fire and appeared
to be less than a half-mile away. They were
unable to see anything else except the little flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody down there, all right,&rdquo; Tim nodded.
&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll look before we knock,&rdquo; Mac
chuckled. &ldquo;It might be the wrong house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They descended the other side of the knoll and
tramped on toward the lone campfire. Underfoot
the snow crunched and broke with a cold, snapping
sound and the rocks were slippery. The stars
stood out brilliantly overhead, and they had no
difficulty in making their way through the Vermont
forest. They rounded a ragged bluff of rock,
and the fire was now very near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow up now and let&rsquo;s get a good look at this
outfit,&rdquo; Mac whispered.</p>
<p>Tim nodded silently, and they began to approach
the camp as noiselessly as possible. Keeping
behind friendly trees, they slipped closer and
closer until they could see around the clear space
in the center of which a small fire burned fitfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t Wolf and his bunch,&rdquo; Mac whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only a man and a woman,&rdquo; Tim returned,
in an equally low tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The camp was occupied by a man and a woman.
Close beside the fire could be seen some camping
equipment, a frying pan which had apparently
been placed in the snow while hot, a knapsack, and
a brightly colored blanket and a pair of gloves.
Against a near-by stump leaned a rifle, and the
man had a hunting knife at his belt. They had just
finished supper, and the smell of fish lingered on
the air. The woman was placing chunks of snow in
a pan, and when this was finished she put the pan
on the fire. There was a sizzling sound as the snow
on the outside of the pot slid into the fire.</p>
<p>Before advancing any further, the boys studied
the man and woman closely. They were dark-skinned
and looked to be French. Both of them
were warmly dressed for winter travel, and their
camping equipment was battered and blackened,
indicating much use. The woman wore a coat with
a rich fur collar, and both of them seemed perfectly
at home in the woods. They exchanged no
words and were engrossed in their tasks. The man
was cleaning scraps from a plate while the woman
waited for the snow to melt.</p>
<p>Tim reached over and pushed Mac. &ldquo;Might as
well go to it,&rdquo; he said, and the brothers left
the shelter of the trees and approached the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>They had advanced several steps before the
campers heard them coming. They had left the
trees and were crossing the clearing. The woman
was the first to hear them, and she lifted her head
with a swift motion, and her black eyes seemed to
glitter like those of an animal who was trapped.
She spoke sharply in French to her companion,
who dropped a plate and rose to his feet, his hand
running backward toward his hunting knife. The
woman looked around at the rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; greeted Mac, not very well impressed
with the manner of the two campers. &ldquo;May we
come into your camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look like you in ze camp now,&rdquo; said the man,
without a smile. &ldquo;What you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re camping just over the hill,&rdquo; Mac explained,
his eyes on the woman, who had picked
up the rifle. She was holding it muzzle down in
the crook of her arm, but her eyes stared at them
in a way that neither of the boys relished. &ldquo;We
found that we had forgotten to bring any coffee
with us, so we saw your fire and came to ask if you
could sell us any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry if we startled you,&rdquo; Tim added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; the man asked again. The
boys looked at him with some astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just told you,&rdquo; Mac answered. &ldquo;We came to
buy some coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You not come to buy coffee,&rdquo; the man said, his
chin coming forward in a way that was far from
comforting. &ldquo;You want somet&rsquo;ing else, eh? You
follow us, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not,&rdquo; Tim denied, indignantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
camping up here and we saw your fire, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman spoke to her companion. &ldquo;Pierre,
listen!&rdquo; She launched into rapid French, and when
she had finished he shrugged his shoulders. She
turned to the boys suddenly. &ldquo;We not got coffee.
We not got anyt&rsquo;ing. You go back to your camp.
Go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a quick motion with the rifle, though
she did not lift the muzzle, which still pointed
downward. There was no mistaking the implied
threat or the fact that the boys were not wanted.
Mac felt angry at their unfriendly reception, but
he felt it best to retreat at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We only wanted to buy a
little coffee. We weren&rsquo;t going to ask you to give it
to us. Come along, Tim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;We got no coffee. We got not&rsquo;ing,&rdquo; the woman
repeated, and the twins turned and walked off,
their eyes on the alert for any sudden move. But
the woodsman and his wife stood by the flickering
fire motionless.</p>
<p>No word was spoken until they were around the
rock bluff, and then the boys looked at each other.
&ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I know,&rdquo; Mac cried.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that the limit? They acted as if we were
a couple of criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably what they are,&rdquo; Tim advanced.
Mac came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course! He said something about following
them. I&rsquo;ll bet those two are a couple of bad
eggs. Maybe we&rsquo;re lucky we got away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim urged him on. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to the camp,&rdquo;
he said, looking over his shoulder. &ldquo;See what the
other boys think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they stalked into camp a delightful smell
of pork and beans greeted them. Kent was piling
fresh wood on the fire, and Barry was stirring a
fork around among the beans. The sled had been
cleaned off and was ready to serve as a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what luck?&rdquo; Barry hailed. &ldquo;Get any
coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;All we got was an order to get out of the camp
pronto,&rdquo; Mac answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost got ordered off with a rifle,&rdquo; Tim
added, stooping down and warming his hands over
the cook fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Barry asked, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Wolf&rsquo;s camp?&rdquo; Kent inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t. This is what happened.&rdquo; Mac
related the story, and the other two boys listened
with interest and astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly got a cool reception,&rdquo; was
Kent&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool!&rdquo; exploded Tim. &ldquo;It almost froze us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry gazed off in the timber in the direction
of the hostile camp. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mighty queer way
for anyone to act when you just go and ask them
to sell you coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they had coffee, too,&rdquo; Mac avowed.
&ldquo;I saw the jar of it. Did you, Tim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brother nodded. &ldquo;As plain as day, right
there beside the fire. But they acted as though we
were poison.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>They were still discussing it when they sat down
to eat, and it furnished the main topic until bedtime.
Gradually they drifted to other things and
forgot the incident. They did not stay up long
after supper. The cold was severe and did not encourage
sitting around for more than an hour after
the meal. After cutting a big supply of firewood
they decided to turn in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good old sleeping bags will serve us well
tonight,&rdquo; Kent said, as they prepared to turn in.</p>
<p>Barry brought a pan of melted snow from the
fire. &ldquo;Here is warm water to wash in,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Hurry up and get at it, or it will
freeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim was the first one to wash, and he toweled
his face and neck with chattering teeth. &ldquo;Good
night, but this is cold business,&rdquo; he ejaculated.
&ldquo;Too icy to wash behind the ears tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac pulled off his shoes and shirt and sat on the
sleeping bag while he washed. Then with a yell
he slipped inside the warm lining of the bag,
doubling up. &ldquo;Boy, doesn&rsquo;t this feel good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take the others long to get into their
bags. Barry and Kent shared one tent, and the
twins had the other. After a few words they went
to sleep, and utter stillness settled over the winter
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Several hours later Barry awoke and crawled
out of the bag, shivering in the cold air. The fire
was low, and he wanted to keep it going so that
they could make a quick blaze in the morning. He
pulled on his shoes and slipped into his Mackinaw.
His hat followed, and then he stepped up and out
of the tent, rubbing his hands.</p>
<p>He halted with a little shock. A short man in
corduroy trousers and woodsman&rsquo;s boots stood at
the edge of the clearing, looking around the camp.
At sight of Barry he crouched and fairly sprang
into the bushes, beating a retreat from the place.
His form had been shadowy and indistinct. Barry
roused from his state of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he called out, sharply. &ldquo;What do you
want? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer from the one who had been
watching the camp. All was profoundly silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br />At Bronson&rsquo;s Cabin</h2>
<p>Kent stirred and sat up in his sleeping bag. In
the dimness of the tent he saw that Barry was not
there. He heard the twins move and say something
in the next tent. Then Kent seemed to remember
that someone had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out here,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;Somebody has
been in the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent and the twins joined him as soon as possible.
Barry was heaping more wood on the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say somebody was in the camp?&rdquo; Kent
asked.</p>
<p>Barry pointed to the spot where the man had
stood. &ldquo;A man was standing there when I just
came out to put more wood on the fire. I couldn&rsquo;t
make his face out very well, but he was a short,
stocky fellow, and I just took it that he was the
Frenchman you boys saw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it was,&rdquo; Tim answered. &ldquo;Any of our
things missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry shook his head. &ldquo;I believe not&mdash;at least I
can&rsquo;t see that anything is. It looked to me as if he
had just arrived. What time is it, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac tugged his watch out of his pocket and
looked at the dial by the light of the fire. &ldquo;Ten
minutes past three a. m.,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they have broken camp and are on
their way,&rdquo; said Tim. &ldquo;They may have just
stopped by to take a look at us. You didn&rsquo;t see the
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I can&rsquo;t even be sure that the man was
that Frenchman. Did he have on brown corduroy
pants and a checked Mackinaw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the twins nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s who it was. I could see that much
by the feeble light of the fire, though I couldn&rsquo;t
see his face. Think we ought to go back to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too sleepy to sit up for any Frenchman,&rdquo;
Kent yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that he&rsquo;ll come back,&rdquo; Mac said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m freezing around here, so I&rsquo;m on my way back
to the bed. Call me for breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Call you nothing!&rdquo; cried Kent. &ldquo;Barry and I
cooked supper, so you fellows are billed to provide
the breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others went back to their sleeping bags, and
Barry built the fire up before seeking his. When
he did crawl back into the soft, warm interior of
the bag he did not go to sleep at once. For a long
time he lay listening, but no sound broke the stillness,
and at last he dozed off and slept soundly.
He was awakened by Kent stirring around and
crawling over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see what these twins have for us,&rdquo; his
companion invited, and Barry followed as quickly
as he could get dressed. The Ford brothers were
already on the job, and bacon was curling in the
pan. The day was gray and overcast, and it looked
as though it might snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess our French friend didn&rsquo;t come back,&rdquo;
Mac said, forking out bacon on the tin plates.
&ldquo;Everything is about ready to eat. Come and get
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast was soon dispatched, and then they
put the camp in order. Before long they were on
the river again, skating along rapidly, in order
to warm up. They had gone scarcely a mile when
bodies were warm and blood tingling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it doesn&rsquo;t snow until we get to the
cabin,&rdquo; Kent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;A big fall would
work against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had planned to eat one more outdoor
meal, but they arrived close to Fox Point around
the noon hour, so they had dinner in the country
store there, eating sandwiches and drinking hot
cocoa at a little table close to the round iron stove
that threw out a splendid heat. They bought the
coffee that they lacked and then started once more.
At last they skated out on the broad expanse of ice
that marked Lake Arrowtip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are at last,&rdquo; Mac whooped. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a race down the lake to the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Barry objected. &ldquo;See how that
snow is spread out? You go a little way and then
you have to walk across a snow bar and strike the
ice on the other side. You just can&rsquo;t keep going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the better,&rdquo; spoke up Kent. &ldquo;It will
be an obstacle race. Skate on the ice, run across the
snow, and skate some more. Let&rsquo;s line up and go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pulling the sled,&rdquo; Barry reminded them.
&ldquo;But you fellows go to it and I&rsquo;ll follow on. Are
you ready? Get set. Go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The three racers were off like a shot, striking
out across the clear ice of Lake Arrowtip. Coming
to the soft snow that spread across their path, they
leaped into it and ran through as fast as their
skates would allow them to. Again they were out
on clear ice, and for a time they skated furiously,
with Mac slightly in the lead. Then another and
longer island of snow slowed them down, and Tim
tipped over, tumbling in the path of Kent, who
had to swerve to avoid going down. By the time
that Kent got on the ice again, Mac was far ahead
and turned around in a swift circle and gave the
race up, waiting for the others to catch up with
him.</p>
<p>Barry skated on in a more leisurely manner,
drawing the sled after him and taking in the
beauty of Lake Arrowtip. He had visited the place
in the spring and summer, but had never seen it
in the grip of the New England winter. It presented
now the picture of a broad flooring of ice,
with the dark lines of pine and hemlock ringing it
around. From the lake the hills ran up sharply,
flowing into the mountains, blanketed with a thick
white carpet of snow. Out in the middle of the
lake stood Rake Island, a rugged little thumb of
land covered with brush and timber and rough
rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Behind them the lake was broad, but before
them it narrowed. Barry could now see the Bronson
cabin and beyond it the roof of the lodge. His
heart beat faster, and unconsciously he skated on
with increased speed. They were close to the scene
of the mysterious events that had interested him so
much.</p>
<p>He joined the others, and they were soon at the
bank before the Bronson cabin. Taking off their
skates, they walked up the slope to this plain little
log house, but their eyes were on the big hunting
lodge. It stood on a bluff and could be approached
only in a roundabout way from the lake, up the
sides of the slopes and not from the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, the house of mystery,&rdquo; cried Tim,
as they took in the length of the low log lodge
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks cold and deserted,&rdquo; Mac offered.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look as though it has any spooks around
it at this time of year. Bet you a doughnut we don&rsquo;t
learn a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mighty poor spirit to start our hunt
with,&rdquo; Barry objected, as he felt in his pocket for
the key to the Bronson cabin.</p>
<p>Up to the moment they had paid no attention
to the cabin in which they were going to live, but
now, as Barry unlocked the door, they scanned it
with interest. It was nearly square and was made
of rough hewed logs. It appeared to be very old,
and there was only one small window to the left of
the door. A rock chimney pushed its way through
the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll like this place when we get used to it,&rdquo;
Kent predicted.</p>
<p>Barry pushed the door open, and they entered.
There was a large general room, and a small lean-to
which served as a kitchen. A single bed with
sooty covers was pushed up against the wall on one
side of the room. A wide fireplace with rusty
andirons in it showed at the back of the cabin
room. Everything was dirty and dreary-looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t been used for some time,&rdquo; Tim commented,
as they stood and looked around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Barry admitted. &ldquo;Dad said it hadn&rsquo;t.
We&rsquo;ll have a lot of cleaning and fixing to do. Also,
we&rsquo;ll have to sleep on the floor in our sleeping
bags, as there is only one bed in the place, and it
doesn&rsquo;t look very inviting. Well, how about it?
Shall we go to work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were entirely agreeable, and they set
to with a will. There was an abundance of work
for everyone, and so the afternoon hours sped
away. Just before dark they united their efforts
and cut enough wood for the winter evening. It
was dark when they had gathered enough, and
then they turned their attention to supper. There
was a rusty iron stove in the lean-to, and between
that and the open fireplace they managed without
any trouble. Supper was a happy affair, and
when the wind rose a little later, they congratulated
themselves that they had a warm cabin to
camp in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it looks a heap cleaner than it did when
we came here,&rdquo; Mac remarked, looking around
with satisfaction.</p>
<p>They spent the long evening chatting around
the fireplace and at last sought their sleeping bags
on the log floor before the fire. Barry opened the
door to throw out some wash water and stood for a
moment, his eyes fixed on the darker mass of the
lodge building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll look into that place,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;I wonder what the secret of it is, anyway?
Well, I hope we&rsquo;ll be lucky enough to find out.
Maybe the haunt will be around tonight to look
us over!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br />The Upstairs Window</h2>
<p>The boys slept soundly throughout the night,
and it was seven o&rsquo;clock before Tim opened his
eyes and looked around the unfamiliar interior of
the Bronson cabin. For a moment he was unable to
place himself, and then the events of the previous
evening came to him. A glance at his companions
showed that they were still asleep. The fire had
long since gone out, and the place was cold. He
struggled up into a sitting position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is cold in here,&rdquo; he decided, slipping
out of the warm bag. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get our fire going
at once. And believe me, I want a more comfortable
bed than that one was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shivered while pulling on his clothes, and
it was with satisfaction that he drew his heavy
sweater down over his head. Then he looked
around for water in which to wash, but the little
that they had was frozen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;No bath until after I get the fire under way
and melt some snow,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably
need a wash worse after building the fire than I do
now, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent woke up and looked at him sleepily.
&ldquo;Hello, half-size! You&rsquo;re an early bird, I see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, full-size!&rdquo; Tim retorted, reaching
for his ax. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out and gather worms for
the rest of you lazy birds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Kent approved. &ldquo;Hurry up and get a
fire going, so that I can get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who isn&rsquo;t up by the time I come back
with wood will get a snow rub,&rdquo; promised the
Ford twin.</p>
<p>All of the wood had been used up on the previous
night, and Tim was compelled to go out and
hunt for a fresh supply. Accordingly he stepped
out onto the hard-packed snow before the cabin,
his eyes quickly taking in the lake and the surrounding
country. For a moment he paused, taking
in the beauty of it all, unconsciously drawing
a deep breath of satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The sun was rising over the tops of the spruce
and hemlocks and striking fire on the sheet of ice.
Icicles gleamed from the roof slope of the big
hunting lodge. At the edge of the timber a rabbit
hopped out into the clearing, looked around with
a jerk of his brown head, and then streaked off into
the undergrowth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By ginger, it&rsquo;s a dandy morning. And those
sleepyheads in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim knew that it was warm and comfortable in
the sleeping bags, but the beauty of the new morning
was worth looking at. He started off toward
the timber to get his supply of wood, and then
noticed a small shack close to the cabin. Investigating
this, he was delighted to find a small stack
of firewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck! This will save me the trouble of
cutting a supply right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slipped the camping ax through his belt and
carried a heaping armful of wood into the cabin.
By this time all of the boys were awake. Kent was
dressing, and Mac and Barry still enjoyed the
comfort of the bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see that you fellows have decided
to get up at last,&rdquo; Tim greeted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were afraid to face your wrath if we
didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Kent smiled. &ldquo;You got that wood in a
mighty big hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was ready-made. Found a small supply
of it in a shack around on the other side of the
cabin.&rdquo; Tim heaped it into the fireplace and
touched a match to the kindling. The boys watched
the flame lick upward and then spread with a
crackling sound to the remainder of the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That feels good,&rdquo; Barry approved, getting up.
&ldquo;The whole outfit thanks you, Timmy boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can express your gratitude in a more lasting
and practical way,&rdquo; Tim informed him. &ldquo;Now
that I have built the fire, suppose you fellows make
the breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll agree to that,&rdquo; Kent said.</p>
<p>Barry began to open the package of bacon.
&ldquo;Tim, as long as you are dressed for the great out-of-doors,
suppose you go get that long extension
handle for the coffee pot from the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Where&rsquo;s the sled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right outside the door,&rdquo; Barry told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember seeing it there, but I suppose
it is,&rdquo; answered Tim, as he made for the door.</p>
<p>Mac rolled up the sleeping bags and put them
away. &ldquo;Do we have to sleep this way every night?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ve got to work out some plan for better
beds,&rdquo; Barry replied. &ldquo;This floor is hard and cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim thrust his head in the doorway. &ldquo;Say, that
sled isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; Kent demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it is not. We left it right here by the
door, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry hastened to the door, followed by the
other boys. &ldquo;Yes, we left it there, with the long
coffee-pot handle and a roll of canvas on top of
it.&rdquo; He looked around the ground and off toward
the timber. &ldquo;It is gone, all right. I&rsquo;d like to know
who took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unmindful of the cold, they were all outside,
standing in a group around the spot where the sled
had been left the night before. The snow was too
solidly packed to reveal any marks of the runners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that means that somebody was around
here last night while we were all sleeping,&rdquo; Barry
remarked. &ldquo;When I threw some water out before
I went to bed, I saw the front runner, so the sled
was here at that time. Anybody hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had. As if by common consent they all
turned and looked at Bluff Lodge, standing solidly
in the rays of the morning sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;When are we going to look through that
place?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime today,&rdquo; Barry promised. &ldquo;But first
we want to see if we can get our sled back.&rdquo; He
studied the ground around the front of the cabin.
&ldquo;Not a mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; cried Tim, who had been doing
some hunting on his own account. &ldquo;Somebody
looked in the window at us last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a row of fingerprints on the ledge
of the window, and the boys crowded around in
excitement. There were ten fingermarks in the
snow that clung to the outside sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if those prints were there before we
came,&rdquo; Mac mused. &ldquo;That snow is hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been made by somebody who leaned
down hard,&rdquo; Kent decided, studying the marks.
&ldquo;You can see where the snow broke under his
fingers. I didn&rsquo;t look at this window ledge before,
so I don&rsquo;t know whether they were here before
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>None of the boys had noticed the marks, but all
of them were inclined to believe that whoever had
stolen the sled had peered in the window and had
made the prints. They were gripped with a feeling
of mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are starting pretty quickly,&rdquo; Barry said,
somewhat grimly.</p>
<p>Mac glanced inside the cabin door and then
sprinted forward with a shout. &ldquo;Hey! The coffee
is boiling all over the place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The accident to the beverage was more of a
benefit than an evil, because the boys had been
standing in the cold air long enough to feel somewhat
chilled. At Mac&rsquo;s frantic whoop they
crowded back into the building, and Kent rescued
the blackened pot, scorching his hands in the act.</p>
<p>They lost no time now in dispatching breakfast,
and during the meal they discussed the trend of
events. The fact that someone had been close to
them during the night put them on their guard,
and they determined to make a search for the missing
sled at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need that sled,&rdquo; Tim declared. &ldquo;When we
go back to town we don&rsquo;t want to have to pack all
the stuff on our backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it if we have to,&rdquo; Barry reminded
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but who wants to? I&rsquo;m wondering
if the one or ones who took it did it for a joke or
because they needed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have been some of Wolf&rsquo;s crowd,&rdquo; Mac
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know if they are anywhere near
us,&rdquo; Kent protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are, I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past them,&rdquo; Mac
went on.</p>
<p>They hastily cleaned the dishes and then left the
cabin, locking the door after them. Another attempt
was made to pick up the trail, but there
simply was no track to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, we&rsquo;ll just have to hike along
and see what we can see,&rdquo; Barry decided.</p>
<p>The rest of the morning was spent in a fruitless
tramp through the woods. They entered the timber
back of the cabin and made a big circle around to
the east, going along for several miles until they
came out on the ice of the lake. During this time
they passed only one home, where they talked for
a moment with some poor children, who were the
only ones home at the time. In all respects it was
a deserted mountain country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>They got back to the cabin at noontime and
dragged a dead limb up before the door, planning
to chop some firewood a little later. Dinner consisted
of a large rabbit that Mac had shot on the
morning trip, and after the meal was over the
mystery hunters went to work. The twins and Kent
began to wash the dishes, and Barry went out to
chop the tree that they had dragged in.</p>
<p>The plan for the afternoon was to make another
search for the sled, this time on the other side of
the hunting lodge. The country in this direction
was much wilder than that on the side where the
Bronson cabin stood, and just beyond Bluff Lodge
they could see the ragged side of an old granite
quarry. It was also part of the afternoon program
to explore the lodge.</p>
<p>Barry worked on the limb with a sharp, long-handled
ax, and soon the pile of stovewood
mounted beside him. After a time he paused to
rest, leaning on the handle of the ax. The vigorous
exercise had made him feel warm. His eyes
traveled over to the lodge, and he scanned the place
with interest, until one fact struck him forcibly.
Quickly he straightened up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>His gaze was fastened upon an upper window in
the low loft space of the lodge. This window was
partly open, and, as Barry looked, a certain conviction
came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer thing about that window. I&rsquo;ve
looked over there several times, and I can positively
testify that it wasn&rsquo;t open before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br />Inside the Haunted Lodge</h2>
<p>Barry lifted the ax and with a single swing of
his arm imbedded it in the side of the tree limb.
Then he stepped to the door of the cabin and
glanced inside. Mac was stacking the dishes up,
and the other two boys were just coming out of the
lean-to kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here a minute,&rdquo; Barry called to them.
Mac lingered to finish his work.</p>
<p>When they had joined him at the door, he
pointed toward the lodge. &ldquo;See anything strange
about the place?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mac joined them in the doorway, and they gazed
at the hunting lodge. &ldquo;Looks the same as ever to
me,&rdquo; Tim said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is a window half open,&rdquo; Kent cried,
pointing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I wanted you to see,&rdquo; Barry
told them. &ldquo;Did any of you notice that it was open
before this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have seen it before this, if it was,&rdquo;
Tim chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I thought,&rdquo; Barry replied.
&ldquo;I was cutting wood, and while I was resting, I
turned and looked at the place. It came to me at
once that all the windows were down the last time
we looked that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then somebody has been in the place while we
were off hunting for the sled,&rdquo; Tim observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way. For some reason he opened
that upstairs window and forgot to close it. Fellows,
we had better go explore that lodge right
now. We can look for the sled later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys needed no further urging. They were
anxious to go through the old place, and now that
the window had been opened they were more than
eager to enter the lodge. Sweaters and caps were
hastily put on, and Barry got the keys to the big
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for looking around for the
sled, we would have been in that place this morning,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>They crossed the snow to the front porch of
Bluff Lodge. This porch extended clear across the
log building and gave a magnificent view up and
down the lake. Twenty-five yards from the porch
the bluff dropped fourteen feet straight down to
the waters of Arrowtip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dandy place to sit and look out over the lake
on a warm summer day,&rdquo; Kent commented, as
Barry fitted his key to the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; his chum agreed. &ldquo;This lodge
ought to be worth quite a bit of money. It would
be, too, if it weren&rsquo;t getting a bad name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Barry had turned the key, and with
a grinding sound the bolt shot back. The boys
crowded closer to him, anxious for their first
glimpse inside the haunted lodge building. Barry
swung the door open wide, and they walked in,
glancing around with interest.</p>
<p>They found themselves in a wide hall that was
square and roomy. A big fireplace took up a wide
space on one side of the wall, and over it hung the
head of an elk. Pictures adorned the walls, and
over a door leading into the other part of the
lodge hung an old flintlock gun. A flight of stairs
led to the loft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a dandy place,&rdquo; remarked Mac, as they
stood and looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if this is the main room, where they
sit around the fire?&rdquo; Kent asked.</p>
<p>Barry moved to the door and pushed it open.
&ldquo;No, this seems to be the living room,&rdquo; he announced,
stepping through the doorway. The
others followed and found themselves in a big
living room, furnished with several chairs and a
long couch that was placed in front of the fireplace.
Shelves of books and some animal skins were
to be seen in this room, and it was unmistakably
the guest gathering place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is more like it,&rdquo; Tim remarked, as they
explored the room. &ldquo;That other place is just the
front hall. Gosh, but it is cold in here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beside the fireplace there were window seats,
and Barry sat down and pulled the curtains aside.
&ldquo;You can see our place from here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This
certainly is a nice lodge, and I&rsquo;d like to own it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Kent opened a door from the living room, and
they continued to explore. A long hall led to the
kitchen at the back of the lodge, and from this hall
three bedrooms and a dining room could be
reached. It was indeed an unusually large log
structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t this be a great place to have a party?&rdquo;
Barry exclaimed, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, it surely would!&rdquo; Kent agreed. He opened
a door and looked into one of the bedrooms. &ldquo;Look
at those nice beds, and we are sleeping on the floor
over at our cabin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim called their attention to a pump on the
back porch. &ldquo;Here we are, melting down snow,
and a good pump close to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet it is frozen stiff,&rdquo; Barry objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, if some hot water were poured down
it to prime it, I believe that we could use it,&rdquo; Tim
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get on upstairs,&rdquo; proposed Barry.
&ldquo;We came over here to see about that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down the hall and through the living
room to the big hall. Barry led the way up the
stairs until they came to a door. This was not hard
to open, and they found themselves in the attic
or loft space of the hunting lodge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>It was a large open space and seemed to be
almost empty. A broken bobsled was over against
one slope of the roof, and two dusty saddles hung
from nails. There were only two windows in the
upper section of Bluff Lodge, and one of them
was slightly open. Barry crossed the floor of the
attic and shut the window, peering out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at those prints in the snow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
seems as though someone may have crossed the
roof and come in this window. There is enough
roof for anyone to walk on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then those tracks were made some time back,&rdquo;
reminded Kent. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had any snow lately.
You can see how the snow melted down into the
tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt of it, the tracks are old,&rdquo; Barry
agreed.</p>
<p>Two chimneys rose straight through the attic,
and Mac wandered around restlessly. The chimney
from the lower hall took up little space, but the
living-room chimney rose several feet to push its
way through the roof. Mac walked around this
brick column while the others looked out of the
window toward their cabin.</p>
<p>Then they heard him utter an exclamation.
They turned to see him motioning from around the
corner of the chimney.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, you fellows! Look what I&rsquo;ve
found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Filled with curiosity, they joined him behind
the tall chimney and found him pointing to a small
pile of half-melted snow that showed on the floor.
Barry knelt and touched it with his finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is snow, all right,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means that somebody has been in
the lodge within the last few minutes, possibly
while we were walking around downstairs!&rdquo; Mac
reminded them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br />A Council of War</h2>
<p>Somewhat startled at Mac&rsquo;s words, the others
looked around the loft and then at each other. The
thought that some unknown person had been in the
building, perhaps at the same time that they were
downstairs, was not a comforting one, and they
felt the grip of excitement and uncertainty. Barry
glanced up at the roof above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hole there for this snow to drop through,
and we haven&rsquo;t any snow on our shoes,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;It surely looks like Mac is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If somebody was here, how did he get out?&rdquo;
Tim asked, peering into the dark corners of the
loft. &ldquo;Think he slipped down the roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be easy for anyone to go out the front
door while we were in the kitchen,&rdquo; Barry reminded
them. &ldquo;If anybody was hiding in the lodge,
he could probably hear us talking and then sneak
down into the hall and outdoors while we were
in the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what has happened,&rdquo; Kent exclaimed
with conviction.</p>
<p>Barry crushed the snow under his fingers. &ldquo;It
hasn&rsquo;t been here very long,&rdquo; he gave his opinion.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have any of it on your shoes, did you,
Mac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ford twin shook his head. &ldquo;No, and I discovered
it before I had walked that far. I wasn&rsquo;t
sure at first what it was, and I had to touch it to
make sure. If that fell off of somebody&rsquo;s clothes,
then somebody was here just a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; Kent nodded. &ldquo;We ought to
go down and look through the house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sooner the better,&rdquo; seconded Barry,
rising from the floor. &ldquo;I must let Dad know about
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Led by Kent, the boys went downstairs and made
a hasty search through the lodge, but found nothing.
It was with considerable excitement that they
looked into each room, not at all certain as to what
they would find, but no one was in the place. At
last they gathered on the front porch and looked
up and down the lake, but no one was in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look around the grounds,&rdquo; Tim
suggested, and they made a tour of the place. In
the rear, back of the kitchen and in a separate
building, they found a variety of garden tools and
odds and ends, but the shed itself was empty of
all life.</p>
<p>The timber came close to the back of the lodge,
and if anyone had been bent on vanishing from
sight in that direction, it would not have taken him
long to do so. Going around on the far side of the
lodge, the boys saw that it was more rugged land
than that on their side. A series of ravines and
gullies ran beside the lodge, and less than an eighth
of mile away rose the scarred side of the old
abandoned quarry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty wild country on this side,&rdquo; said Barry,
as they halted under one of the bedroom windows
to look around.</p>
<p>Tim approached the gully closest to the house
and gazed down into it. &ldquo;People who camp in this
lodge don&rsquo;t want to go walking at night,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Not in this direction, anyway. They had better&mdash;&mdash;Well,
I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; they asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like our sled down there! It is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The others joined him at the edge of the gully.
Down below them a few feet they could see the
sled, partly turned over, the front runners buried
under some snow-laden bushes. Tim slipped down
into the depression and located the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is where he hid the sled!&rdquo; Kent exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we tramped for miles looking for it!&rdquo;
Barry shook his head.</p>
<p>Tim toiled up the slope, dragging the sled after
him. &ldquo;He did more than hide it there,&rdquo; he informed
them, handing the rope to Mac to pull.
&ldquo;Whoever put it there just threw it in. One front
runner is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry helped Mac pull the sled up. It was a low
flat wooden affair with steel runners. Part of the
wood over the front runner had been smashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some nerve on the part of whoever did it,&rdquo;
growled Barry, as they examined it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
knock the stuffing out of the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided a man did it,&rdquo; Kent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody did it, and I suppose it is the
same one who has been prowling around this
lodge. I mean to find this ghost or whatever it is
that is making the trouble at this place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as though we ought to do some watching
at night,&rdquo; Mac suggested, as they made their
way around to the front of the lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over a little later,&rdquo; Barry promised,
locking the front door of the lodge. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got to get our firewood in and prepare for the
night. These days are short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutting wood and preparing for the night took
them the rest of the brief winter afternoon, and
then supper followed. The sun had gone down a
dull and misty red, and the wind was moaning
through the trees. There was every indication of a
storm, and the boys were hoping that they would
not be snowed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a splice on that broken sled runner,&rdquo;
Kent offered, as they sat at the supper table. He
was the best carpenter of them all, and they were
willing to let him do the mending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;That will fix it so
that we can use it on the way home. Whoever took
our sled didn&rsquo;t steal the canvas or the frying pan
and the long coffee-pot handle, so he must have
taken it just to scare us off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just gave the sled a polite boot into the
gully,&rdquo; grumbled Mac.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that gets under my skin,&rdquo; cried Barry.
&ldquo;He came and stole our sled before he knew why
we had come here to camp. I wouldn&rsquo;t think so
much of it if he had done that after we had been
through the lodge, but he didn&rsquo;t even give us that
long. Something has got to be done, and we might
just as well decide what it will be right here at this
council of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we ought to take turns sitting up and
looking out of the window,&rdquo; Mac gave as his idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty cold, thankless job,&rdquo; Kent shook his
head. &ldquo;Hang it all, we didn&rsquo;t do a thing today
about making better beds, and so far I haven&rsquo;t
enjoyed my sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I have been thinking,&rdquo; Barry
said slowly. &ldquo;I believe that we ought to move into
the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence as the others
considered his words, slightly startled at the proposition.
&ldquo;But your Dad told you that he wanted
us to stay in this cabin,&rdquo; Tim reminded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did at that time,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;But
the whole situation has changed since then. If we
are to get on the track of the mysterious spook of
the lodge, we won&rsquo;t do it from here. We ought to
be right inside of that hunting lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the boys were silent, considering it. &ldquo;I
know that we will be a whole lot more comfortable
on those beds over there than we are here,&rdquo; Kent
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be a lot better off in several ways,&rdquo; Barry
pointed out. &ldquo;It is a bigger place, and we&rsquo;ll have
more elbow room. Then we&rsquo;ll be closer to the
actual scene of His Majesty the Spook&rsquo;s activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That spook gets snow on him, same as any
human,&rdquo; grinned Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; nodded Barry. &ldquo;Because he is
human. It&rsquo;s just some mean person up to a slippery
game, but who it is or why he is at it, nobody
knows. And if we are going to find out, we&rsquo;ll have
to hustle, because our time here is going by fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move over there tonight!&rdquo; Tim suggested.</p>
<p>For a moment they were swayed by the thought,
and then Kent and Barry shook their heads together.
&ldquo;Too much of a job at this time of night,&rdquo;
Kent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t much to move,&rdquo; Tim protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;But the lodge is
too cold. We&rsquo;ll have to spend a full day warming
up the place. We have only two lanterns, and
while I noticed some lamps over there, I don&rsquo;t
know whether they have any oil in them or not.
We&rsquo;ll do better to wait until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking it by and large, I believe it is the best
thing to do,&rdquo; commented Mac. &ldquo;This little cabin
does very well as a shelter from the storm, but it
isn&rsquo;t very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been well taken care of,&rdquo; answered
Kent, looking around. &ldquo;Some of the chinking is
out between the logs, and that lets the air in. This
table is thick with grease and looks like it never
was cleaned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bronson has been renting it out for a long
time,&rdquo; explained Barry. He got up from the table.
&ldquo;After we have washed the dishes I&rsquo;ll write a
letter to my father and tell him that we have
decided to move into the lodge&mdash;in fact, I&rsquo;ll tell
him everything. He might even run up here himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we know something more definite by
the time he does,&rdquo; observed Mac.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Later in the evening Barry wrote a letter to his
father relating events in detail and informing him
of their contemplated move. While he was busily
engaged at this, the other three boys were working
on the broken runner board. Kent had decided to
cut out a new one from a piece of board which he
had found in the kitchen, and with the aid of ax
and knife he managed to carve out a fair section
of runner board. With the help of the twins he
fitted it into place, and before long the job had
been successfully completed.</p>
<p>Before they retired for the night Barry opened
the door of the cabin and was surprised to see the
soft white flakes falling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing,&rdquo; he told
his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though we are going to move into the
lodge just in time,&rdquo; Kent predicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that this doesn&rsquo;t turn into a blizzard,&rdquo;
Barry thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br />A Disturbed Night</h2>
<p>The sight of the falling snow gave the boys a
new channel for conversation, and they were slow
about going to bed. They had put everything soft
that they could find under their sleeping bags and
looked forward to a fairly comfortable night in the
log cabin. Since the snow had begun falling the air
had become much warmer, and the inside of the
little building was warm and inviting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thick, heavy snow,&rdquo; Tim remarked, after
peering out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone comes near the cabin tonight, we
ought to see his footprints in the morning,&rdquo; Mac
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Kent denied. &ldquo;If it keeps on snowing
this way, any tracks would be covered up in a
very short time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it kept up this way for a long time, we&rsquo;d
be snowed in here for a while,&rdquo; Barry told them.
&ldquo;We might not get back to school in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would break my heart!&rdquo; Mac grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know anything, you ignorant
duffer?&rdquo; Kent asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I knew about all there was to know,&rdquo;
Mac returned blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re smarter than most humans,&rdquo; Barry
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept!&rdquo; grinned the twin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask Pa about that sometime,&rdquo; said Tim,
slipping inside the bag. &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;ll have a different
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire blazed up in the chimney, and the
shadows leaped and darted on the walls. A split
log popped, and a blazing ember shot out across the
hearth and landed close to Kent&rsquo;s sleeping bag. He
put his arm outside of the bag and flicked it back
into the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of you get hot in the night, you&rsquo;ll know
that a spark landed on you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know so much, what made that wood
pop like that?&rdquo; Barry asked Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expansion. Heat expanded it and made it
burst.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. What made that popping sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a secret that we scientific men keep to
ourselves,&rdquo; answered Mac soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d all quit talking about such nonsense
and let me go to sleep,&rdquo; grumbled Kent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tired after our tramping around today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s go to sleep,&rdquo; Mac urged. &ldquo;Tomorrow
I&rsquo;ll explain all these deep things to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;We can hardly wait
until we hear them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were as tired as Kent, and they were
willing to drop their good-natured conversation
and drift off into slumber. Nor did it take them
long. They were active and healthy boys, and sleep
was a thing that they needed and enjoyed. In a few
moments they were all breathing deeply, and quiet
settled over the Bronson cabin.</p>
<p>The fire continued to flare, and occasionally it
popped, but no more embers left the chimney. The
snow came down gently and settled on the frame
of the window until the little panes became round
from the clinging white flakes. The wind was rising
slightly, and now and then a puff came down
the chimney and caused the fire to leap and twist
upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The slumbers of the mystery hunters were rudely
broken into by a sudden medley of shots and yells.
The boys woke up with a start, and as they did
so two more shots rang out. Then stillness succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Barry asked, as they sat up
in the bags and looked around in the semigloom.
The fire had sunk down, and a glance at an old
alarm clock that Kent had brought with him, and
which stood on the stone chimneypiece, showed
that it was a quarter of two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shots,&rdquo; was Kent&rsquo;s answer, as he kicked his way
out of the bag. &ldquo;Several of them, and close to here,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard some yells,&rdquo; put in Tim.</p>
<p>All four of them were now up and hastening into
their clothes. Mac swiftly tossed some wood on the
fire, and in the increasing light they hurriedly
dressed. Barry peered out of the window as he
pulled his sweater down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anybody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is still snowing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Kent took his rifle from a nail upon which he
had hung it, and handed Barry his. &ldquo;I guess we
had better take these with us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No knowing
who is out there, shooting around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the yells we heard, it sounds as though
somebody was winged,&rdquo; Mac said, as he took the
shotgun that the twins shared between them. Tim
placed his ax in his belt, and they were ready to
go out into the night and investigate.</p>
<p>Barry opened the door, and they stepped out. It
was still snowing, but the flakes were finer now,
and there was a brisk wind that moaned through
the tops of the trees and whipped the snow into
whirling shapes and formations. The boys left the
cabin cautiously, but no one challenged their coming,
and they stood in the snow outside the door,
their hands in pockets, feeling the change from
the warm inside to the cold outdoors. Much snow
had fallen since they had gone to bed.</p>
<p>For a moment they were silent, listening for any
sound that might break the stillness or rise above
the gusts of wind, but although they strained their
powers of hearing, no sound reached them. Then
a flash of light out on the lake caught their attention.
It lingered only a moment and then was gone,
and after a brief interval, it came again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is running across the ice!&rdquo; Barry and
Mac said in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kent agreed. &ldquo;And they have a flashlight
that they are turning on every once in a while.
Wonder who they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they are the ones that yelled,&rdquo; said Tim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heading for Rake Island,&rdquo; Barry observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe whoever is putting on all the funny
business around the lodge hides away on Rake
Island,&rdquo; Kent suggested. &ldquo;We ought to search that
place one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Barry promised. He glanced toward
the dark hunting lodge. &ldquo;Which way did those
shots come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say from just behind the lodge,&rdquo; Tim answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemed that way to me,&rdquo; Kent agreed. &ldquo;They
were mighty close to this cabin of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over there and see if we can find anything,&rdquo;
Barry suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the lantern,&rdquo; Mac offered. &ldquo;You fellows
want your hats and gloves?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>They agreed heartily that they did, for the night
air was penetrating, and before long the sandy-haired
twin was back with the lantern and their
warmer clothing. In a short time they set out across
the open space toward the lodge, keeping a sharp
watch on every side. The flashes no longer came
from the lake.</p>
<p>Back of the lodge they flashed the lantern around
the ground, looking for footprints, but the snow
had been blown around in such a way as to make
it impossible for them to find any. They did not
waste many minutes in the hunt, as the cold was
too keen, but soon gave it up and started back to
the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; Barry announced. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
not going to stay out here long. That wind feels
like a knife. Me for the fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions were of the same mind, and
they were approaching the cabin when Tim
stopped and fumbled into the snow. When he
straightened up he held an object in his hand, and
as soon as he had wiped it off he whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Look here, fellows. A rifle shell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys bent over his extended hand and examined
the metal cartridge with interest. Then Kent
began to brush through the snow in search of
others. Before long he had found three more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the fellow stood that fired those
shots,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty close to our cabin,&rdquo; Barry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These shells came out of a big rifle,&rdquo; Mac observed.
&ldquo;Did you see that shell on the ground,
Tim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my foot struck it. I felt something harder
than the snow, and I reached down to see what it
was. As soon as I touched it, I had an idea what it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry looked away in the direction of Rake
Island, shrouded in the darkness. &ldquo;It all means
that somebody stood here and fired at least four
shots from a rifle at someone else,&rdquo; he said slowly.
&ldquo;The ones who were shot at scuttled away across
the ice. I&rsquo;d like to know what it all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get in around the fire and look these shells
over,&rdquo; Kent urged, and they were soon back in the
cabin, grouping around the warm fire and looking
at the empty cartridge curiously. The ones that
Kent had found were exactly the same, and there
was no doubt that they had all been shot from the
same gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to me that there were more than four
shots, but perhaps I just imagined that,&rdquo; Barry
said, sitting down on the sleeping bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing was so sudden and unexpected
that I hardly know what did happen,&rdquo; Mac admitted.
&ldquo;The shots were near us, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost outside of our window,&rdquo; Kent nodded.
&ldquo;Gosh, that gives me something to think about, do
you know it? The light of our fire would show
anyone that we were here, and whoever fired the
shots might have been protecting us. See what I
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that those people who ran across
the ice may have been looking in at us and were
scared off by the shots?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Or maybe the ones who did the shooting
were looking in at us and were disturbed. Of
course, any way you look at it, it is all pure guesswork,
and we know as much about it as we do
about the whole mystery business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that we are going to move over into
the lodge,&rdquo; declared Barry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bigger place,
and I&rsquo;ll feel safer in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, though, that the lodge is the home
stamping ground for the spook,&rdquo; Mac reminded
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is, but we seem to have had a lot of
visitors and prowlers around here. I don&rsquo;t feel
quite safe any more. If we did stay in this cabin,
we&rsquo;d have to build some sort of a shutter to put
over that window, so that people couldn&rsquo;t come
looking in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe it was any of Carter Wolf&rsquo;s
friends?&rdquo; Tim inquired.</p>
<p>Barry smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to hang everything
against his account, just because he has no use for
us. No, I hardly think so. I wonder if any of his
bunch carries a rifle big enough for these shells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might,&rdquo; Kent said. &ldquo;Some of his friends
are sports and have good equipment. We know
that he is somewhere near here, but I just don&rsquo;t
think that they had anything to do with it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that artillery practice was too close to
suit me,&rdquo; Mac declared, as he began to get ready
for bed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wondering if anyone was hit or if they
just yelled because they were scared,&rdquo; murmured
Barry, as the boys prepared to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we should have gone on down to the
lake to see if anyone was hurt or not,&rdquo; admitted
Tim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Mac placed fresh fuel on the fire, and they
talked for another half-hour about the mysterious
event of the night. The wind was rising and blowing
more strongly, and the old cabin shook under
the force of some of the blasts. At length the boys
became quiet and sank away into deep sleep.</p>
<p>It seemed that they had scarcely closed their eyes
when there came a thunderous booming crash that
jarred the cabin. Something scraped down the roof
and fell to the ground back of the lean-to kitchen.
At the same time some stones fell into the fire,
which had sunk to red embers, scattering it to right
and left. The boys bounded up from their beds
with rapidly beating hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Tim shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something hit the cabin,&rdquo; Barry said, as he
reached for his clothes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it took part of the chimney,&rdquo; Mac
pointed out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a light and we&rsquo;ll see what
it was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Kent threw the remaining wood on the fire, and
Mac lighted the lantern. It was just five o&rsquo;clock,
an hour which rather surprised the boys, as it was
still pitch dark outside. They dressed as quickly
as possible, waiting for further sounds, but all was
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that somebody bumped against
the side of the cabin?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumped it with a battering ram if he did,&rdquo;
Barry retorted. &ldquo;That thump was on the roof. Let&rsquo;s
see what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seized the lantern, and the others followed
him out into the early-morning air. The blackness
was growing faintly gray in the east, and before
very long the sun would be up. But the boys were
not interested in these things at that moment. They
walked out to a place where they could look at the
roof of the cabin.</p>
<p>One glance told the story. A big limb had blown
down and landed on the roof, knocking off a corner
of the chimney. Part of the limb had slid down the
back part of the roof, but the heaviest portion was
still balanced on the peak of the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tree limb!&rdquo; Kent cried. &ldquo;We might have
known it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big one, too,&rdquo; Barry observed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
to pull it down before we leave this cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the whole house was coming down
when it hit,&rdquo; Mac grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to go back to sleep?&rdquo; Tim inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep?&rdquo; echoed Kent, in disgust. &ldquo;Not for me!
It&rsquo;s morning, anyway. If we did go to sleep, something
else would be sure to happen. I&rsquo;m sleepy,
but no more for me. What a fine night that turned
out to be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br />A Surprise Visit</h2>
<p>Satisfied by their inspection, the boys now went
back into the cabin and began to fix things in
order. All of them felt sleepy and somewhat
dragged out, but in no mood to return to the sleeping
bags. Faint streaks of real daylight were spread
across the sky, and a new day was at hand.</p>
<p>It was still snowing lightly, and the wind was
cutting and sharp. Before long it was evident that
there would be no sunshine that day. The sky was
heavy and overcast. The trees were loaded with a
mass of clinging white flakes, and the whole landscape
was clothed in a simple beauty that the boys
admired with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the sun would come out, how this snow
would flash and sparkle!&rdquo; Kent remarked, as they
tucked away the bedding and prepared to get
breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;No sun today,&rdquo; Barry predicted. &ldquo;In fact, I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we have more snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to move over into that lodge this morning?&rdquo;
Mac inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Barry nodded. &ldquo;But first we want
to go down to the lake and see if we can find any
clues to what went on last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to scout around a little and see if
we can find anyone in the woods who did the shooting,&rdquo;
Tim suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the best we can,&rdquo; Barry assured them.
&ldquo;I want to get to the post office at Fox Point and
mail my letter to Dad. We won&rsquo;t be here much
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t, worse luck,&rdquo; sighed Kent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to stay right here until we do solve the
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we aren&rsquo;t going to,&rdquo; Mac shook his
head. &ldquo;It gets deeper all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has got to get more wood,&rdquo; Tim
called from the lean-to. &ldquo;Who are the brave lads
who will volunteer to chop or die for their native
land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m brave, but this isn&rsquo;t my native land,&rdquo; Barry
grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better do it, Tim,&rdquo; Mac suggested.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always carrying a little hatchet around
in your belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no hatchet, that happens to be an ax,&rdquo;
growled Tim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all set to cook breakfast, and
as it is going to be a tough job to cut wood under
the snow, I&rsquo;m calling for volunteers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s honest about it,&rdquo; commented Barry. &ldquo;It is
hard work, so he wants somebody else to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the chopping,&rdquo; Kent said suddenly.
&ldquo;Come on, Mac, you go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac stared at him suspiciously. &ldquo;You seem
mighty anxious. Where are you going to find a log
to cut into?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the roof, my boy,&rdquo; grinned Kent. &ldquo;All
we have to do is to toss a rope up and snake it
down. Once it descends to the ground, we will fall
on it tooth and nail and reduce it to kindling
wood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac seized his ax with alacrity. &ldquo;And that
means that the next time wood is cut, those two
have to cut it wherever they can find it, doesn&rsquo;t it?
That&rsquo;s fine! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sold,&rdquo; Barry smiled at Tim. &ldquo;The boys
have put one over on us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Mac and Kent went to work at once on the limb
that hung over the peak of the roof. Standing on
Kent&rsquo;s shoulders, the twin looped a rope over a
jagged stump of a limb and then jumped to the
ground. Both of them pulled on the rope and the
limb came sliding down the roof and thudded to
the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good, dry piece of timber,&rdquo; Kent exulted.
&ldquo;This will be easy to chop up for firewood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fell to their task with a will and soon had
an ever-growing pile heaped up close to the front
door. Barry came out to get some of it, and Tim
started the fire in the rusty stove. Before long the
delicious smell of bacon drifted out to the wood-choppers.
Mac stopped and sniffed with rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, just smell that bacon! Isn&rsquo;t that the finest
aroma in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is when you are out camping,&rdquo; Kent
granted. &ldquo;Everything seems to taste so good when
you are out in the open a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacon, eggs, and coffee! What a combination!
Say, while you fellows are at Fox Point today, why
don&rsquo;t you get some sausage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask Barry, or whoever goes, to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Breakfast was soon ready, and they tackled it
with enthusiasm. Just as soon as the meal was over
they set the cabin in order. All of them were anxious
to get out and explore the lake front, but they
were good campers and had an instinctive aversion
to leaving the camp until it was in first-class condition.
This was speedily done, and then they
donned their outside coats and their hats and were
ready to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking guns?&rdquo; Kent asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;Not that we expect
to use them for defensive purposes, but we
might see some game that we can knock over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the cabin and locked the door after
them. &ldquo;Nothing in there of value except our provisions,
skates, and sled,&rdquo; Mac remarked. &ldquo;But I
suppose it is best to lock up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll explore a little and then get back to our
moving,&rdquo; Barry proposed, as they plodded along
through the snow down the slope to the lake. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want to spend another night in the Bronson
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>They soon reached the shore of the lake and
searched it for footprints or other clues, but were
unable to find anything. Proceeding along the edge
of the frozen water, they hiked almost as far east
as the mouth of the Buffalo River. When they were
opposite Rake Island, Kent came to an abrupt halt
and pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, some fellows are on Rake Island. See
them watching us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing across the ice sheet, they saw five
figures standing in a group, apparently looking in
their direction. Just as they noticed them, the group
on the little island started across the lake toward
them. The boys at once halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming right at us,&rdquo; Barry remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look like Carter Wolf in the lead?&rdquo;
Tim asked.</p>
<p>Kent nodded. &ldquo;Just what I thought. We&rsquo;re in
for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five to four,&rdquo; murmured Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your horses,&rdquo; Barry advised. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know what they want, and besides that we have
guns and they haven&rsquo;t anything in their hands.
Don&rsquo;t let them get near enough to take anything
away from you. Maybe they only want to buy
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t very well picture Carter Wolf wanting
to buy anything from us,&rdquo; Kent shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The members of the island camp soon drew close
to them, and there was no doubt that it was Carter
Wolf and some of his friends from a neighboring
town. These boys were expensively dressed, and
Wolf wore a big fur coat and hat that looked odd
as a camping outfit. They carried no weapons with
them, and it was impossible to imagine what their
object was.</p>
<p>They approached the mystery hunters, and the
silence between the two groups was strained. Barry
decided to make the advances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he greeted.</p>
<p>The other boys made no answer, but they slowed
up and finally stopped a few feet away. Wolf&rsquo;s
face wore a frown, and his companions stood
slightly in back of him. They were all boys who
did not look especially healthy, and the boys from
the cabin knew that they were all drinkers and
considered themselves to be good sports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tried pretty hard to hit us last night, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Wolf began aggressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with whatever
happened last night,&rdquo; Barry answered him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that,&rdquo; sneered Wolf. &ldquo;Just because
you saw us sitting on the porch of that lodge, you
blazed away at us. I can have you arrested for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent looked at him coldly. &ldquo;The fact of the
matter, Wolf, is that we were asleep in the Bronson
cabin at the time that shooting happened. We
got dressed and came out as soon as we could, and
you and your friends were running across the ice.
We didn&rsquo;t have a thing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m to believe it or not,&rdquo; scoffed the
boy from the island.</p>
<p>Tim dug down into his Mackinaw pocket. &ldquo;I
guess we can soon settle that question,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Here are the empty shells that we picked up
outside our cabin after the shooting. You can see
that they are far too big for our little rifles, and
you know that it wasn&rsquo;t a shotgun that was fired at
you. Need any further proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that the boys from Rake Island
did not, but they were in anything but a pleasant
frame of mind. They were anxious to make trouble
but had no ground to stand on. Wolf tried a new
line of attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your father has charge of that lodge,&rdquo; he accused
Barry. &ldquo;If anything had happened to us, he
would have been responsible. We had been up the
lake to a dance hall and came back late. All we
did was to sit down on the porch of the lodge
because Hodge here was unsteady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be telling all you know,&rdquo; spoke up a boy
with a pasty, unhealthy-looking face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, somebody shot at us,&rdquo; Wolf went
on. &ldquo;If we had been hit, your father would have
had to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Barry denied. &ldquo;I guess you
know that the lodge has the name of being haunted,
and you were taking your own chances when you
sat on the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fine day our bunch will go up there and
crash in,&rdquo; Wolf boasted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what all this
ghost business is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can find out what it is, my father will be
grateful to you,&rdquo; Barry assured him. &ldquo;But I
wouldn&rsquo;t crash into the lodge, if I were in your
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me advice, Garrison! I don&rsquo;t need
any, and if I did, I wouldn&rsquo;t come to you for it.
You know that if I ever get a chance to square
accounts with you, I&rsquo;m going to!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any account to square,&rdquo; Barry returned
levelly. &ldquo;You just think you have. We&rsquo;re
not looking for any trouble with you, Wolf, and
the farther you stay away from us, the better we&rsquo;ll
like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to give you fellows a good
beating,&rdquo; cried Wolf, starting forward. But a companion
named Carl Voss pulled him back quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on back to camp and leave these kids
alone,&rdquo; he advised, his eyes upon the weapons
hanging across the boys&rsquo; arms. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t shoot
at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf allowed himself to be dragged away, but
his eyes were sullen and revengeful. &ldquo;Some day
it will be my turn to crow,&rdquo; was his parting word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re doing all the crowing right
now,&rdquo; murmured Tim, as they watched the other
party start back to the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br />In the Grip of the Storm</h2>
<p>For a few moments the boys from the cabin camp
watched the Rake Island boys walk across the ice,
and then Barry turned away. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t time to stand around idle. Remember
that we want to move today, and already we have
spent a good part of the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other followed him, and they started back
to the camp. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned something, anyway,&rdquo;
Kent remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was the Wolf bunch that was shot at,&rdquo;
Mac nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, we&rsquo;re just as much as ever in the dark as
to who did the shooting,&rdquo; Tim reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as though whoever did the shooting
did it to scare them off,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;They
weren&rsquo;t hit and didn&rsquo;t say anything about the shots
going overhead. I guess that crowd didn&rsquo;t have
anything to do with taking our sled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;For a while I thought that they did,&rdquo; confessed
Kent. &ldquo;But evidently they didn&rsquo;t know anything
about it. Somebody keeps mighty close tabs on the
lodge and even objects when anybody sits on the
front porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will they do when we go to live in the
place?&rdquo; Barry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may make it warm for us,&rdquo; Tim suggested.
&ldquo;So far we have been living in the Bronson
cabin, and they haven&rsquo;t done any more than steal
our sled and throw it into a ravine. But now we
are moving up on the ghost, and maybe things will
get lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I believe we ought to be prepared for
action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;Perhaps we ought
to take turns staying up at night and keeping a
strict watch. I have an idea that some dangerous
criminal is operating around that lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there are any counterfeiters making
money anywhere in the neighborhood,&rdquo; Mac
mused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; Barry admitted. &ldquo;Whatever they
are, someone doesn&rsquo;t want anybody to hang around
the lodge. We&rsquo;ll just have to show them that we
intend to stay there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; Kent approved.</p>
<p>Still discussing the things nearest their minds,
the boys arrived at the cabin close to dinner time.
After some thought they decided to postpone their
moving until the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim and I can move the things over, if you and
Kent want to go to Fox Point,&rdquo; Mac told Barry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to go mail my letter,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;And
we need some things from the store there, kerosene
in particular. Our lantern is about empty, and
we&rsquo;ll want some oil for the lamps in the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to forget Mac&rsquo;s sausage,&rdquo; smiled Kent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take us any time to move our few
things over there,&rdquo; Tim said. &ldquo;You boys go ahead,
and we&rsquo;ll manage the domestic affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreed to, and after the midday meal
Kent and Barry prepared to start out. They took
the sled with them, but decided not to skate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a couple of miles up the lake
and then down the river,&rdquo; Kent argued. &ldquo;We can
cut our distance by going through the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ice is almost covered with snow anyway,&rdquo;
observed Barry. &ldquo;We can hike it as quickly as we
could skate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strapping the long kerosene oil container to the
sled, they were ready to start out. The twins
watched them from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come to a good hill, you can sit on the
sled and coast down,&rdquo; Mac grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all right if you don&rsquo;t run up
against a stump,&rdquo; Tim added.</p>
<p>Barry slipped the sled rope through his belt and
they were off. &ldquo;See you in our new quarters before
long,&rdquo; he called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a warm fire by the time we get there,&rdquo;
Kent requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget coffee and butter!&rdquo; Tim yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sausage!&rdquo; Mac whooped.</p>
<p>With a laugh and a reassuring wave the two
boys with the sled entered the woods and were lost
to sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Barry and Kent struck off in a southeasterly
direction through the woods. They knew that Fox
Point lay in that direction and were interested to
see how near they would come to it. There was no
definite path to follow, and so they wound around
bluffs and between the trees, checking their course
by a pocket compass. The forest was a fairly open
one, and the trees stood well apart, making it easy
to draw the sled. Underfoot the snow made a soft
carpet.</p>
<p>The entire day had been a gloomy one, and the
sky was gray and heavy, with a strong hint of snow
in it. Darkness would come quickly, and the two
boys were aware of the fact and determined to lose
no time in making the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we push on at a fast pace, we should be back
at the lodge before it gets dark,&rdquo; Kent said, as
they crossed a brook and started up a hill slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t linger in the store,&rdquo; Barry promised.
&ldquo;It will be dark earlier than usual tonight, and
we&rsquo;ll have to make a flying trip of it. I suppose we
should have started out this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so, if we had wanted to take our time
about it. Oh, well, I&rsquo;m sure that we&rsquo;ll make it all
right. Beginning to snow, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent was right. Lazy flakes of snow began to
drift down through the trees, and when they
reached the top of the hill they could see for some
distance. In every direction the air was filled with
softly falling flakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t come down any harder than that,
it won&rsquo;t bother us any,&rdquo; Kent remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell about that,&rdquo; his companion said.
&ldquo;Some pretty hard storms start out mildly. Those
clouds above look to be full. However, we won&rsquo;t
borrow trouble until we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crossed a somewhat thicker section of timber
and came to the top of another rise of ground.
Barry pointed ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that church steeple? I believe that is Fox
Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is, we&rsquo;ve hit it pretty well. It won&rsquo;t be long
before we know for certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set off once more and before long came to
the edge of the woods and saw the little crossroads
village of Fox Point before them. A few houses,
a general store, and a church and school building
made up the tiny country village. The boys went at
once to the store and, leaving the sled outside, were
soon warming their hands at the big iron stove in
the center of the store.</p>
<p>Then Barry began to order supplies, and Kent
wandered to the window, looking down into the
road. Presently he called to his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that is the French couple that Mac
and Tim saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry joined him at the window and looked
down. Two horses were tied to a railing at a water
trough which was empty, and as the boys looked
out at the scene, a man and woman got on the
horses. Barry recognized the man at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the fellow who came into our camp
that morning,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Filled with curiosity, the storekeeper came over
and joined them at the window. The boys watched
the French couple ride off and enter a path that
led into the woods below the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people been around these parts a few
days,&rdquo; the owner of the store confided. &ldquo;You acquainted
with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but early one morning the man was standing
looking over our camp,&rdquo; Barry told him. &ldquo;Two
of our friends visited them in their camp once, but
we don&rsquo;t know anything about them. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The storekeeper went around the counter and
began to tie up packages. &ldquo;I know they are mighty
mysterious people. Won&rsquo;t say who they are or what
they want. The other night they come in the store
and I asked them what I could do for them. Said
they didn&rsquo;t want nothin&rsquo; but to wait for somebody.
Pretty soon a car come along and blowed the horn
outside and they went out to it, and that was the
last I see of them until today. Nobody knows anything
about &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have any rifles today,&rdquo; Barry said
to Kent, when the storekeeper had moved off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that. They must have settled somewhere
to stay.&rdquo; Kent chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it hurts
these people not to know what they are doing
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packages were soon ready, and the boys
took them out and tied them in place. Over the top
they spread the canvas to keep the snow out, and
then they were ready. Barry looked around and
then shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beginning to snow harder and faster,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to step right along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Fox Point behind them, the two boys
started off through the woods toward Bluff Lodge,
striding along as fast as they could. The snow was
coming down hard, and before they had gone two
miles it was blinding. The two chums said very
little, but both of them were apprehensive as the
sky grew darker and the whirling flakes more bewildering.
Their clothing became white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;We got into a good one this time,&rdquo; Barry called
to Kent, as they rounded a high rocky ledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! Say, did we pass that ledge on
the way to Fox Point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Hang it all, I can hardly see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pressed on, picturing the twins in the lodge
with a warm and glowing fire to welcome them.
The loaded sled was a trifle heavy owing to the
opposition of the increasing depth of snow, and
they relieved each other frequently.</p>
<p>They had traveled on for over a half-hour, peering
through the storm and almost feeling their
way, when Kent stopped and pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There is that same ledge. We&rsquo;ve come
around in a complete circle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry nodded bitterly. &ldquo;We have. I hate to
admit it, but we&rsquo;re just lost! And if you ask me,
we&rsquo;ve managed to get lost at a mighty serious
time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br />New Quarters</h2>
<p>The twins watched the departure of their chums
and then turned back into the house. Mac closed
the door and walked over to the fire, rubbing his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do to get far away from the fire these
days,&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for long,&rdquo; his brother admitted. &ldquo;We had
better get over to the lodge and start a fire there.
That place is going to be cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it will take some time to warm it up,
too. Did Barry leave the key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim took it from his pocket. &ldquo;Here it is. Let&rsquo;s
take some of the stuff and go on over there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>They put on coats and hats and, taking a few
things with them, left the Bronson cabin and
crossed to the lodge. Tim unlocked the front door
of Bluff Lodge, and they went in. The interior of
the lodge was cold, and their breath stood out in
dense white clouds. Without lingering in the hall
they went directly to the big living room and put
their equipment on the window seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing we had better do,&rdquo; Mac suggested,
&ldquo;is to get the fire going. This fireplace looks
like a good one, and it shouldn&rsquo;t take long. Want
to put paper in while I go haul a load of wood on
the sled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got the sled,&rdquo; Tim reminded him.
&ldquo;Barry and Kent have it, so you&rsquo;ll have to carry
some over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, I had forgotten. They took the sled
to bring home the well-known bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or your sausage,&rdquo; Tim grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be mine alone. You know that you like
it yourself and so do the other boys. Well, I&rsquo;ll be
back in a few seconds with some wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got much of it,&rdquo; Tim said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to cut some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. That is the biggest job we have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Mac left the lodge, and Tim busied himself
piling some newspaper which he had brought in the
fireplace. There were some ashes left from a previous
fire, and he cleaned them out and carried
them in a pail to the kitchen, where he unlocked
the back door and took the pail out to where the
bushes grew in a wild tangle. Here he dumped
the ashes and then looked around. The door of the
Bronson cabin was open, and he could see Mac
inside.</p>
<p>Returning to the lodge, his eyes lighted on a
small shed joined to the kitchen. It was one part
of the lodge that they had not inspected, and his
curiosity was aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what that place is. But I suppose it is
locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried the knob on the door that led to the
small shed and found that it was locked. The key
ring for the lodge was still in his pocket, and he
took it out, examining the keys closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key to this shed may be on the ring. Nothing
like trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fitted two keys to the lock on the shed, and
the second one fitted. One turn and the lock
slipped back. He pulled the door open and peered
inside. Then he gave a whistle of surprise and
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coal, by ginger! Half a shed full of coal. I
must tell Mac about this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>He did not linger long out in the crisp air, but
returned to the living room of the hunting lodge.
Just as he reached the fireplace, Mac came in with
a load of wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the last of it,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to cut some more before it gets dark, and
we&rsquo;ll have to hustle to it because it is getting
darker all the time. We&rsquo;re in for a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to cut some wood,&rdquo; Tim told him.
&ldquo;But I made a great discovery, Mac. There is
a shed joined to the kitchen, and it is half filled
with coal. That means an end to our wood-chopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t belong to us,&rdquo; Mac interposed, practically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but if we pay for what we use, it ought
to be all right. In the little time left for us to stay
here we won&rsquo;t use much. Come on and look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led his brother to the coal shed, and Mac
inspected it. &ldquo;I suppose it will be all right,&rdquo; the
sandy-haired twin nodded. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t, Barry will
tell us when he gets back here. At any rate, we can
use it to warm up the room in there, and it will do
the job quicker than wood will. Let&rsquo;s take a bucket
of it in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;This coal explains why they use grates in the
hall and the living room,&rdquo; Tim said, as they filled
a coal pail that hung close by.</p>
<p>Returning to the living room of the lodge, they
quickly built the fire. The flames licked their way
up through the paper and over the wood, and
when this had caught fire in good style they put
some coal on. As the fire blazed out in a comforting
manner, the brothers stood and watched it
with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first fire in this room for many a day,&rdquo; remarked
Tim.</p>
<p>Mac grinned. &ldquo;That ghost or spook must be a
cold-blooded fellow, prowling around here in
rooms as cold as these are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim glanced out of the window. &ldquo;Mac, it is
snowing again, and I have a hunch that it is going
to snow hard. Let&rsquo;s get some more wood in before
things close down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we had better. Some of that limb over
at the cabin is left, and we can get our supply off
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The twins took their axes and hastened to the
limb before the cabin. Falling to with a will, they
soon had the wood supply mounting. The storm
increased as they worked, until they could scarcely
see for the whirling flakes. For some time they
were silent, saving their energy for the task before
them, but their minds were on the same subject.
Mac leaned on his ax for a breathing spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that the boys will have a hard time
finding their way through this storm,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Tim stopped chopping and looked anxiously
toward the forest, which could barely be seen.
Both boys had a goodly quantity of snow on their
shoulders and hats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking the same thing,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;You can hardly see the woods from here.
And they don&rsquo;t know the way very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they can see better in the woods than
we can out here in the open,&rdquo; said Mac hopefully.
He began to chop again with vigor. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
through here and get back in the lodge. By golly,
we can hardly see anything ourselves, and we
might get lost without much trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>They carried their wood into the lodge and
then returned to the cabin for a final load of their
camping equipment. Satisfied that they now had
everything, Tim locked the door and trotted across
the open space to the hunting lodge. He paused at
the door for a final look at the white, storm-tossed
world about him, and an anxious frown gathered
on his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish Kent and Barry were back here!
I don&rsquo;t see how they can possibly find their way
in a storm like this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More troubled than he cared to admit, Tim
joined his twin before the fire in the large grate.
&ldquo;Might as well take off our coats and make ourselves
at home, hadn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking about priming that pump
on the back porch. I&rsquo;m tired of snow water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. But I&rsquo;m afraid that pump is frozen
solid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, but some good hot water
poured in it ought to break it loose. It is warmer
today than it has been most of the time. Want to
try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. How will we heat water? There is
nothing to hang a kettle on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac examined the fireplace closely. &ldquo;No, there
isn&rsquo;t. But we could set the kettle right on the coals.
Wouldn&rsquo;t hurt the kettle any.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look in the kitchen and see what we can
find there,&rdquo; Tim proposed. &ldquo;We could start a fire
in the stove and heat our water there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we had better not use up our wood on
a kitchen fire,&rdquo; Mac shook his head. &ldquo;For tonight
we can get along with this grate fire. We don&rsquo;t
know how long this storm will last, so we will have
to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They traversed the long hall to the kitchen and
examined the pots and pans that hung on hooks
under the shelves. From the closet beside the cook
range Mac brought out a curiously shaped pan. It
was flat on one side and had a long handle to it. A
hook curved out from the flat side, and there was
a hinged cover for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens kind of a pot is this, Tim? I
never saw one like it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim looked it over with interest. &ldquo;Hanged if I
know,&rdquo; he began, then suddenly his face lighted
up. &ldquo;Why, Mac, this must be a pan to hang on the
grate. This hook goes over the top grate bar,
and you can heat water in it. Just the thing we
need!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just exactly what it is,&rdquo; Mac nodded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some snow, and we can melt it down and
then try our luck on that pump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They filled the grate pan with snow and then
took it in and hooked it on the top bar of the grate.
There was now no doubt in their minds that the
utensil was meant for its present use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While that is melting and heating, let&rsquo;s get the
lamps in here,&rdquo; Tim suggested, and they brought
the oil lamps in from the bedrooms. There was
very little oil left in them, and the boys had only a
scanty supply in their lanterns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have plenty when Barry and Kent get
here,&rdquo; Mac remarked, looking out at the storm.
But the scene that met his eye was not a reassuring
one. If anything, the storm was increasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That snow has melted down and will soon be
hot water,&rdquo; Tim said, after a glance into the grate
pan. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better get another pan of snow
and keep melting it, because that pump will have
to be primed more than once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>This was done, and as the water became hot the
boys kept adding snow. At last the pan was filled
with boiling water, and they poured it into the tea
kettle, and after refilling the grate pan with snow
they set off for the back porch to try their luck
with the pump. Tim carefully poured the boiling
fluid down the neck of the rusty iron pump shaft.
Steam arose as the hot water came in contact with
the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do get this thing going, we&rsquo;ll have to
prime it every morning,&rdquo; Mac predicted, standing
first on one foot and then on the other and moving
about to keep warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt of that. Gosh, it is getting colder.
Good thing this porch shelters us from some of the
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They poured pan after pan of boiling water
down the pump shaft without attaining the end
they were seeking, and were about to give it up as
a bad job, when Mac felt the pump handle move
with a sucking sound. He pressed harder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Put another
dose in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim did so, and the water came pouring up,
bringing with it a mixture of ice and rust flakes.
The brothers worked the handle vigorously, and
soon a stream of clear water flowed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, we made it,&rdquo; Tim exulted. &ldquo;Thought
we weren&rsquo;t going to, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;So did I. That water looks good. Wait until I
get a glass from the kitchen, and we can have a
good drink of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They filled some pails with the water and then
returned to the house. Darkness was beginning to
settle, and their spirits became more and more depressed.
It was close to five o&rsquo;clock, and the blackness
of night soon closed entirely over the lodge.
Tim lighted a lamp, and they were comfortable as
far as light and warmth were concerned. But their
minds were far from easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use talking, the boys have either stayed at
Fox Point or they are lost,&rdquo; Mac sighed, as they
looked out of the window into the thick blackness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they stayed,&rdquo; Tim shook his
head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that they started on the return
trip and got caught. The tough part is that if we
go out to look for them, we would probably be lost
in a short time, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br />Mysterious Knocking</h2>
<p>For a moment after Tim&rsquo;s discouraging words
the twins stood and stared helplessly out at the
darkness of the night. From every angle the situation
was a serious one. If the country had been familiar
to them, they would have attempted to go
out and look for Barry and Kent, but they had
only a sketchy notion of the hills and valleys. The
wind was blowing the snow around in such a way
that even the stoutest woodsmen might have been
confused and lost on such a day. To the Ford boys
it seemed anything but cheering that their chums
were somewhere abroad in the storm and darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what to do,&rdquo; Mac confessed,
after they had stared out into the night for some
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Tim turned from the window and took off his
hat and coat. &ldquo;The first thing we had better do is
to get our things off,&rdquo; he recommended. &ldquo;It is getting
mighty warm in here now. Then we had better
get supper ready. They might come in yet, Mac.
Maybe we&rsquo;re only borrowing trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; his brother agreed, brightening up.
&ldquo;They may have waited at Fox Point until it blew
over and will be here later. But if this keeps up,
they&rsquo;ll have to come here on snowshoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is getting deep. Well, what shall we do
about supper? We aren&rsquo;t going to build a kitchen
fire, and we won&rsquo;t eat in that big dining room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can make this room our headquarters
for about everything,&rdquo; Mac nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bring
in that table from the kitchen and set it right here
by the fire. It will just fit our needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willing to occupy their minds with something
besides worry, the two boys went to the kitchen
and carried out the small table that Mac had
spoken about. It was just large enough for the four
of them, and they found clean knives and forks
in the drawer, but Tim washed them for the sake
of safety. After this was done he put them around
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set four places,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Mac glanced at the clock and noted that it was
close to six. &ldquo;Sure, set four places, they&rsquo;ll be along
soon,&rdquo; he said, but his voice lacked conviction,
and both of them were more alarmed than they
would care to admit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we have for supper?&rdquo; Tim inquired,
beginning to dig among the stores that they
had brought over from the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping to have sausage,&rdquo; Mac smiled.
&ldquo;But I guess we had better not count on it. Open
a can of pork and beans. I&rsquo;ll fix the coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while they worked silently. The fire was a
mass of glowing red coals, and the room was
lighted by one lamp. They could see well enough
by this light and did not intend to light another
one, because they thought it best to save for an
emergency. Tim put the beans on to warm, and
Mac made coffee. While these things were coming
along, the brothers sat on the wicker couch and
stared into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the other boys aren&rsquo;t cold while we are
enjoying this fine fire,&rdquo; Mac murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be around the stove at Fox Point,&rdquo;
Tim hoped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. On the other hand, we can&rsquo;t help but realize
that they may be out in the woods, wandering
around. Hang it all, I hate waiting worse than anything
else on earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim sprang up and went to the window, peering
out. &ldquo;So do I. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;No, the storm is
pretty bad, and we had better not get away from
the lodge. Listen to that old wind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac couldn&rsquo;t help listening to it. With a shrill,
whistling sound it tore around the lodge and made
some of the windows rattle. The fire in the grate
was vigorous and glowing because of it. Already
the coffee was bubbling, and a tempting odor came
from the pot on the coals. Had the other boys been
there with them, they would have thoroughly enjoyed
it all, but just now its attraction was lost in
the air of uncertainty that surrounded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we moved out of the cabin just in time,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;That little old place is something of an
antique, and it was colder than it should have
been. I&rsquo;ll bet the wind is coming in under the door
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim nodded, looking around the room they
were in. &ldquo;Yes, this surely is a great improvement.
Wicker couch and chairs, window seats and well-filled
bookcases. How shall we sleep tonight? In
the bedrooms?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Too cold. This couch will be
good for one of us to sleep on, and if we lug the
mattresses in here, we can make dandy beds. I have
an idea that the sheets and everything else in those
rooms would be as cold as ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim took the pan of beans off of the fire. &ldquo;These
are ready, and the boys aren&rsquo;t here yet, though it
is after six. Want to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac shook his head. &ldquo;Not yet. Let&rsquo;s wait awhile.
We can heat them up again when they come. I&rsquo;ll
go get some more coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his coat and hat on and took the coal
pail. Tim silently handed him the flashlight. Mac
went out the door and down the hall, while Tim
stared into the fire.</p>
<p>Mac did not stay out long, and when he got back
he rubbed his hands. &ldquo;Man alive, but it is cold!
Say, the boys have no lantern with them, have
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only a flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t keep a lantern going, anyway, on
a windy night like this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Silence again fell between them, and at last it
was seven o&rsquo;clock. Tim looked around the room
and then got up. They had put the lamp out and
had been sitting in the light of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac, they aren&rsquo;t coming, so you and I had better
eat something. I know you don&rsquo;t feel much like
eating, and neither do I, but it will do us good to
pack something solid away inside of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never felt less like eating,&rdquo; growled Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. I realize just now how you feel. But
we might need our strength later on, and we can
do more for the boys on a full stomach than we
ever could on an empty one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; his brother nodded. &ldquo;If we only
knew something! It is the uncertainty that makes
it all so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they warmed the beans and coffee,
and when the food had been placed on their plates
and the beverage in the cups, they began to eat. It
was a hasty and a silent meal, for they were oppressed,
and neither of them possessed any appetite
to speak of. The two empty places at the table
haunted them, and they found it hard to keep various
alarming thoughts out of their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to light a lamp and put it in
the window, as a guide for them,&rdquo; Mac proposed,
when they had finished their meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Tim agreed. &ldquo;They may come
along late, and any kind of a light will be a help
to them. We haven&rsquo;t got much oil, but we&rsquo;ll use all
that we have in a lamp for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac picked up a taboret and put it on the window
seat. &ldquo;Put the lamp on top of that,&rdquo; he directed.
&ldquo;That ought to shine for quite a distance.
If the oil runs out, we can go until daylight without
any. We&rsquo;ll get enough coal in here to last all
night, and we won&rsquo;t have to build a new fire in the
morning. If they haven&rsquo;t come in by that time
we&rsquo;ll have to go after them, storm or no storm.&rdquo;
Tim placed the lighted lamp on the taboret, and
the boys felt that they had done all that could be
done under the circumstances. Mac sat on the
couch in a reclining position, and his brother
squinted at the titles on the backs of the books in
the bookcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try a little reading,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
know how successful it will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac yawned and slid a little lower. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too
tired and worried to read,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Better not get
hold of a spook book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea,&rdquo; Tim replied. &ldquo;I
need something exciting to keep me awake and take
my mind off of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He finally found a book that suited him, and,
drawing a chair close to the lamp on the taboret,
he started to read. Mac sank lower on the couch
and soon fell asleep. Tim read on. It was a little
colder over near the lamp than he wished for, but
he didn&rsquo;t want to take the lamp away from the
window.</p>
<p>A sudden clear tapping on the window back of
him caused Tim to start violently and almost drop
his book. It came on the glass of the window at the
end of the room and not where the light was. Tim
jumped up joyously, sure that the boys had returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mac! Wake up! The boys are here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac bounded to his feet. &ldquo;They are? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim was at the dark window, peering out. &ldquo;They
just knocked here. I can&rsquo;t see them, but they just
tapped on the glass while I was reading. Almost
scared&mdash;&mdash;There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are at the back door,&rdquo; Mac whooped,
seizing his flashlight. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;re the committee
of welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll surely welcome them,&rdquo; Tim agreed, as
they made their way along the hall to the kitchen.
Mac quickly turned the key in that door and drew
back the knob. The door opened, but no one was
there. The boys looked around the porch and
flashed the light into every corner, but without success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure that knocking came from the back
door,&rdquo; Tim exclaimed, when they failed to find
anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I. Maybe they are trying to put something
over on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; admitted Tim, doubtfully. &ldquo;But I
should think they would have had enough of being
out in the cold. Well, they aren&rsquo;t here. We had
better go in. Your flashlight is getting weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about shot.&rdquo; Mac locked the door, and they
walked slowly down the hall toward the living
room. It had just occurred to them that they were
in what was known as a haunted lodge, and various
thoughts were crowding into their minds. In the
living room they looked uncertainly at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if the boys would play any such foolish
stunts,&rdquo; Tim remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, too. Of course, it&rsquo;s a good opportunity
to have a little fun with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Tim cried, holding up his hand.</p>
<p>There were three distinct thumps on the side of
the lodge, and then all was quiet. Then a loud and
insistent knocking came on the front door. The
twins looked at each other with startled eyes. Then
Tim took the lamp, and they started for the front
door. Mac took up the poker as they passed the
fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open the door,&rdquo; he said, and while Tim
held the lamp he turned the key and pulled the
knob. The door came open with a rush, and the
wind snuffed the lamp flame out in a twinkling,
and yet not so quickly that the Ford twins could
make out the fact that there was no one near the
front door.</p>

<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br />The Quarry Shed</h2>
<p>Barry and Kent stood in the storm-tossed woods
and gazed with sinking hearts at the ledge of rock
before them. It told them in unmistakable terms
that they were lost and, as Barry had truly said, at
a very serious time. After all of their recent pushing
on, they were right back at the place where
they had been a short time before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how we came to go around like
that?&rdquo; Kent asked, as he brushed snow from the
front of his coat and tried to see around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy to do in a blinding storm like this one,&rdquo;
Barry replied. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re into it for fair. Shall
we try it again, or turn back to Fox Point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to turn back,&rdquo; Kent protested.
&ldquo;Mac and Tim will be badly worried, and I&rsquo;d like
to make it through, if we possibly can. Which way
do you think we ought to go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were going right, and yet we came
around in a circle. Trouble is, it is getting so confounded
dark. Want to try going on again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;ll go more west than we have been
going. We can&rsquo;t stand here and freeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started forward once more, striking out in
a new direction which seemed to both of them to
be the right way. The wind was searching and they
lowered their heads, both to keep their faces out of
the cutting blast and to shelter their eyes from the
driving snow. The sled, dragging along back of
them, made slow progress through the mounting
snow, and it caught frequently on the snags and
bushes. From time to time they changed and took
turns pulling it, but after a time Barry halted and
came close to his chum, whom he could scarcely
see in the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to leave the sled,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Kent nodded, knocking snow off of his collar.
&ldquo;I have been thinking that, too,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t make any progress with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put it somewhere near a landmark, so
that we will be able to find it again,&rdquo; Barry proposed,
trying to look around. &ldquo;After the storm we
can come back and locate it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we ever do come back alive,&rdquo; said Kent.</p>
<p>Barry slapped him on the back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come
back, all right. We&rsquo;re only temporarily bewildered
in a snowstorm. Let&rsquo;s find a place to leave the
sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent took his flashlight off the hook on his belt
and flashed it around. The light of it revealed falling
flakes and an ever-increasing depth of snow on
the ground. Advancing a few yards, they came to
a tall shaft of rock and earth that formed a shelter
from the driving power of the New England
storm. It was with relief that they got out of the
direct path of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is as good a place as any,&rdquo; Barry proclaimed,
pulling the sled in close to the foot of the
small bluff. &ldquo;We may have a hard time finding the
spot, but at least we know the sled will be under
an overhang of dirt and stone. This wouldn&rsquo;t be a
bad place in which to spend the night, if we had
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate the thought of staying out in this cold all
night,&rdquo; Kent shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. Seems like my skin is pinched hard. I
wonder if we can&rsquo;t start a fire going here and eat
something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Kent again flashed the light around. &ldquo;It will be
a hard job, but it will be worth trying. I think we
can get some dry wood out of that log over there.
As long as we have the sled with us, we ought to
use the food on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We haven&rsquo;t anything to make coffee
in, and about the only food we can eat is the
steak we bought. We can spear that on a stick and
cook it. Let&rsquo;s try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost feeling their way, they began to chop
into the wet log with the camp axes which they
carried at their belts. The top wood was soft and
pulpy, and even that which they hacked out of the
heart of the log was not very dry. After the most
tiresome efforts they succeeded in getting a pile of
questionable wood together, and then came the task
of setting it afire. Both of them huddled close to
the pile and jealously guarded the tiny flame of the
matches as they attempted to ignite the sticks and
bits of wood. Six matches were soon wasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks hopeless,&rdquo; Barry sighed. &ldquo;Even the
good store paper won&rsquo;t light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent jumped up. &ldquo;What dummies we are! This
storm has us buffaloed! We have two long containers
of kerosene oil on the sled!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good night!&rdquo; exclaimed Barry, in disgust.
&ldquo;Of course we have! Douse this wood with it and
then we won&rsquo;t have any trouble starting our fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unscrewing the top of a container, Kent poured
some of the oil on the massed-up wood and then
replaced the oil can on the sled. This time they had
no difficulty, and when the match flame touched
the oil-soaked wood, the fire ran rapidly from chip
to chip until all were blazing. The cold and hungry
boys stooped low and held out grateful hands
to the flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t a fire feel good?&rdquo; Kent exulted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; his companion echoed. He
straightened up and began to search under the sled
canvas for the steak which they had purchased at
Fox Point. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get at our cooking right
away, because when the oil burns off, this wood is
going to be poor material, especially when we add
more to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; Kent acknowledged.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut a couple of sharp sticks to cook the steak
on.&rdquo; He took out his hunting knife and hacked at
some bushes that showed dimly in the shadows
from the fire. Before long he had procured two
fine shafts, and then he proceeded to sharpen a
point on each one. In the meantime Barry cut the
steak in two and then cut it again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some of those things on the sled ought
to go with us when we leave here,&rdquo; he observed, as
he thrust the pointed stick through the steak. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know how long we may be on the march,
and we&rsquo;ll want food with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we haven&rsquo;t got a knapsack along,&rdquo;
Kent declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, but we have some good pockets that will
take a few things. Once this storm clears, we&rsquo;ll be
able to see something. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t
know when it will let up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They became silent, holding the portions of
steak over the blaze, and soon the meat was browning
and the juice dripping into the fire. As Barry
had said, the quality of the blaze soon became poor,
and when fresh fuel was added it was uncertain
and smoky. But they managed to eat their steak,
and it went a long way toward giving them a better
feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I missed salt and bread with it,&rdquo; Kent smiled,
as they finished the steak. &ldquo;But it certainly was
good all by itself. Well, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that we ought to go on. This fire
doesn&rsquo;t amount to anything, and there is no use
hanging around here all night. We don&rsquo;t want to
use up our oil on the fire, and we would have to
work all night to cut wood for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s tie the canvas down tight over the
sled and cover it up with some branches so that
no wandering animal can get into it,&rdquo; Kent proposed,
and they spent some time in doing this.
When this task had been attended to, they set out
once more, heading into the dashing flakes once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The twins will be badly worried,&rdquo; Barry said,
as they stumbled along, making better time now
that they were no longer held back by the burden
of the sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they will. I hope they won&rsquo;t come out and
try to find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that they will. They can see how bad
the storm is and that they would be lost in no time
at all. Boy, that flashlight of yours is a life-saver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no question that the flashlight was
tremendously valuable. Kent used it sparingly and
turned it on only at intervals, but it guided them on
their journey. They kept on going and at last were
ready to give up in despair, as they had passed no
home and even the country did not look familiar
to them. At last Barry halted and looked around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Flash your light up,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Where are
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent played the light around him, and they saw
that they were in an old quarry. The rock walls
gleamed in the faint light of the flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarry!&rdquo; Barry cried.</p>
<p>Kent played the light down toward the ground,
and they saw a small shed. &ldquo;There is shelter, if we
need it,&rdquo; he began. At that moment the flashlight
slipped out of his hand and fell into the snow.
&ldquo;Doggone it,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;I dropped the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of them stooped to search for it and then
paused as they heard a sound near them. Someone
was approaching, and they felt a great relief as
they realized it. Neither of them spoke, and a moment
later a light flashed out, evidently from a
flashlight. The beam rested on the shed, and the
boys waited to see the face or form of the one who
held it. But they were destined to be disappointed.
A hand came into the center of light and turned
the knob on the shed door. The hand was sheltered
in a black glove, and that was all that they saw of
the person who opened the door of the quarry shed.
The light was instantly extinguished and the door
slammed shut. They heard a key turn in the lock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who that was?&rdquo; Kent asked. He had
found the flashlight, and they both stood up and
tried to see things more clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Funny he didn&rsquo;t hear us or see
our light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind is too loud for him to have heard us.
Seems as though he should have seen our light.
Going to ask for some help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. We don&rsquo;t know our way, and we
need to have someone tell us. We&rsquo;ll knock on the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approaching the small quarry shed, Barry
knocked on the door, and they waited. The wind
still blew strongly, and the flakes drifted down
into the abandoned quarry. No answer came to
their summons, and Barry tried again. They listened
with growing impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder he wouldn&rsquo;t open the door or at
least call out,&rdquo; Kent growled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Barry took Kent&rsquo;s flashlight and flashed the beam
around. The shed was backed up against a dirt section
of the quarry wall, and the windows were
boarded up. It was impossible to look into the little
shelter. He walked around on the far side and
found that conditions there were the same. Then
they once more stood before the door and listened.</p>
<p>Barry kicked the door. &ldquo;Is anybody here?&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re two boys that have lost our way,
and we want to ask directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only answer was a profound stillness from
the inside of the quarry shed. The boys looked at
each other, and angry thoughts leaped into their
minds. They had been adrift in the cold and storm
so long that this lack of common humanity on the
part of the man whom they had seen enter the shed
aroused them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hiding in there and won&rsquo;t answer,&rdquo; Kent
cried. &ldquo;We ought to kick the door in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what he&rsquo;s hiding for,&rdquo; Barry
said. &ldquo;He must have some reason for not wanting
to talk to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br />The Black Shadow</h2>
<p>Losing his temper for the moment, Kent
launched two heavy kicks against the door of the
quarry shed. The sound boomed out across the big
cleared space, and the boys listened expectantly,
hoping that this vigorous summons would bring
results. But no answer came to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s break in,&rdquo; Kent proposed. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
freeze to death out in the open, and besides that,
I&rsquo;d like to tell that man inside what I think of him.
We can crash that door down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Barry was swayed by the idea. It
seemed to them as though they had been cold and
lost for ages, and the prospect of warmth and shelter
from the driving wind was alluring. But as he
considered it, he shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ought to, Kent. For some reason
that we don&rsquo;t know, whoever went into the shed
is hiding. That shows he is up to no good. Such a
person may have a gun on him, and if we break in,
we may get shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right, but I do want to have a
few words with that fellow. No matter who he is
or what he is up to, he could at least shout out directions.
What are we going to do? Wait awhile
until he comes sneaking out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could do that. We could hide and watch the
place and then go into it when he comes out. But
look here, isn&rsquo;t this quarry familiar to you? Isn&rsquo;t it
the one we can see from the lodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent looked around, impatiently brushing the
snow from his collar. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. All quarries
look the same, especially in a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, but how many quarries are there
near the lodge? Only one that I know of, and we
can see that one from the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is true,&rdquo; said Kent, thoughtfully, &ldquo;we
have just wandered around in a big circle and
come around in back of the lodge instead of approaching
it from the side. By golly, we may be
almost home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.&rdquo; Barry pointed
through a gap formed by the quarry and the dark,
snow-laden trees of the forest. &ldquo;The lodge would
be in that direction, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Shall we hike that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s go. No use standing around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose we&rsquo;re wrong? We ought to try and
get back here and break into this little building.
We might wander until we&rsquo;re exhausted, drop and
then freeze. More than one hunter has done that,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we find we&rsquo;re wrong, we&rsquo;ll try and make our
way back here,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;But I just have a
hunch that the lodge lies in that direction. We&rsquo;ll
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spurred on by the faint hope that they might be
somewhere near their camp, the boys hurried out
of the bowl of the quarry and once more plunged
into the woods. They found that their feet had become
numb from standing, and they winced as
they began their journey. The wind was still sharp,
but the snowflakes had thinned out and the storm
was obviously letting up. There had been considerable
snow, however, and their feet sank deep into
it as they traveled on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that the storm is letting up,&rdquo; Barry
said, as they tramped on, heads down and faces
bent to escape the bite of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be a help,&rdquo; Kent acknowledged. &ldquo;But
isn&rsquo;t this cold intense? I&rsquo;d give something to be out
of this wind and to get my feet warm. I don&rsquo;t want
to kick a rock or a tree root, for fear of knocking a
couple of toes off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get up to the top of this slope, we may
be able to see our way and figure out where we
are,&rdquo; Barry consoled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had mighty bad luck,&rdquo; Kent said. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t come across a single home, and there are
some in these mountains, but our wanderings have
taken us away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we had run across a house, we could
have put up for the night. We may do so yet. Well,
in a few minutes we can see something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toiling on up the slope, they came at last to a
break in the timber, and their anxious eyes scanned
the dark landscape for any signs that might guide
them. Then Barry pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that is a light off there? It&rsquo;s pretty
small and still some distance away. What do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a light to me. We might as well go
in that direction and see. It is as good as walking
around blindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set off at a faster pace, and soon there could
be no doubt that a light of some kind was before
them. The confirmation of their hope caused their
spirits to rise rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is either our camp or some house,&rdquo; Barry
said, as he walked on with a new vigor in his stride.
&ldquo;Whichever it is, it means warmth for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it is the camp, but if it isn&rsquo;t, a house will
be all right,&rdquo; observed Kent. &ldquo;Unless the people
there are like the man who hid in the quarry shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t find many like that, thank goodness,&rdquo;
Barry remarked.</p>
<p>For a short distance they lost sight of the light as
they crossed a low section of ground where many
bushes grew, and then when they once more came
out on high ground a joyous shout burst from Kent.
&ldquo;It is the lodge!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Hurrah, we&rsquo;re located
at last. See the old cabin over there, beside
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is no doubt of it,&rdquo; agreed Barry,
thankfully. &ldquo;Boy, does that place look good to me!
Before long we&rsquo;ll be hugging the fire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give it a big bear hug,&rdquo; Kent promised.
&ldquo;Gosh, I am glad to be back safely. Things looked
black for us for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly did,&rdquo; Barry agreed, soberly.
&ldquo;Too bad we didn&rsquo;t bring the sled on with us, but
we just didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Kent assured him. &ldquo;With this
depth of snow on the ground it was hard to pull the
sled, and we have made better time without it. I
believe we can find our way back to the place
where we left it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. We&rsquo;ve got to get Mac&rsquo;s sausage for
him! To say nothing of our oil and the other things
on the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their spirits were climbing with every step, and
now that the cold adventure was about over with,
they felt strength and confidence returning. With
the knowledge that they would soon be reunited
with the boys in the lodge, they were beginning to
forget the suffering and anxiety of their wandering
in the storm.</p>
<p>They approached the lodge from the timber that
grew close to the back of it, and as they drew
nearer, they heard three loud thumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys must be nailing something on the
walls,&rdquo; Barry remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they left that lamp in the window,&rdquo;
Kent observed. &ldquo;It has been a life-saver for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes one of them around the house,&rdquo;
Barry exclaimed. &ldquo;I wonder what he is doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The returning travelers were just on the point
of leaving the shelter of the trees and crossing the
open space to the lodge when the appearance of
someone from the porch stopped them. A figure in
black raced along the side of the lodge and
crouched near the window where the lamp stood.
At the same time the lamp was taken away and the
boys in the woods saw Tim&rsquo;s face briefly through
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s not Tim or Mac!&rdquo; Barry cried, in a
low tone, as they stood and looked at the black
shadow stooping beneath the window. &ldquo;The boys
are in the house! Something is going on here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something funny, too,&rdquo; Kent quivered. &ldquo;Want
to tackle that fellow by the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Barry could answer, the black shadow
straightened up and ran to the back of the lodge,
disappearing in the tool house. The man seemed to
have a long overcoat on, and he was a weird sight
as he fled with long, loping strides to the tool house.
Barry grasped Kent&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kent, that&rsquo;s the spook of this lodge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; his companion breathed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got to get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; proposed Barry, rapidly. &ldquo;You sprint
for the lodge and get the twins. Bring the guns with
you. I&rsquo;m going to watch that tool house so that the
man doesn&rsquo;t get out and give us the slip. Step to
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent needed no urging. He was a little too stiff
to run well, but he did the best he knew how and
covered the distance from the woods to the lodge
in fairly good time. The porch creaked as he ran
across it, and he threw open the front door without
ceremony. Then he received a surprise as he came
face to face with the twins.</p>
<p>They were standing in the cold hall, and Tim
held the lamp, which Mac had just lighted. The
poker was on the floor at Mac&rsquo;s feet, and they
turned with startled faces as Kent dashed in at the
door. Then Tim&rsquo;s face darkened with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was you fellows, after all,&rdquo; he began,
with some heat. But Kent interrupted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was like fun! There is a man hiding in the
tool house. We saw him run around the lodge. Get
the rifles and come on! Barry is watching the tool
shed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twins lost no time. Mac forgot about the
poker and ran into the living room, returning with
the rifles and his hat and Tim&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the lamp?&rdquo; Tim asked, as he seized
his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it here,&rdquo; Kent returned, curtly. &ldquo;I have
my flashlight. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They raced across the front porch and jumped
into the snow, the twins shivering with cold as they
came in contact with the outside air. Barry had
moved in from the timber and was standing near
the back porch. Mac tossed him his rifle, which he
caught on the run. Tim had taken the poker, and
Kent had his rifle. Mac alone was not armed, but
Kent passed the flashlight to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still in there,&rdquo; Barry told them, as they
stopped outside the door. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken my eyes
off of the place since you left, and he hasn&rsquo;t come
out. Turn on the light, whoever has it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Mac pressed the button, and the beam of light
showed the door. Barry wasted no time in summoning
the one who was inside. With his rifle held
forward he pushed the door of the tool house. Kent
was close to him, and Tim brought up in the rear.</p>
<p>They were all excited and a trifle scared, but the
general feeling was that the black shadow should
be captured at once. Under Barry&rsquo;s push the door
yielded slightly, and it was evident that it was not
locked. He gave it a stronger push, and it rushed
back against the wall with a crash. The light from
the flash swept into the shed.</p>
<p>Their nerves were tense and eyes strained as they
looked about the tool house. And it was Barry who
voiced the conviction of all of them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got away! There&rsquo;s no one in the place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br />Down River</h2>
<p>The mystery hunters were astonished and baffled
as they gazed into the interior of the tool shed of
the haunted lodge. No one was in the place. The
garden tools hung in order, a large bale of hay
stood back against the wall, but no human being
was to be seen. Nor was there anywhere to hide.
Mac turned the beam of the light upward. There
was no loft, only some cross braces of wood that
would not hide even a cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we saw him come in here,&rdquo; Kent protested,
as they stood and looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I never took my eyes off of the shed,&rdquo;
Barry added. &ldquo;I ran across from the woods and
didn&rsquo;t even watch my footing because I wanted to
keep my eyes on the place. I can&rsquo;t figure it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim pointed to a small window in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he slipped through that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Barry crossed the floor of the tool house and
tried the window. It was not locked, and it lifted
inward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he might have, though I don&rsquo;t see why I
shouldn&rsquo;t have seen it at the time. Looks as though
that was his only way. Perhaps he heard or saw me
running across to the back porch and he slipped
out of the window as we were approaching the
front. Too bad, but he is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that it was our spook, too,&rdquo; Mac
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look around back and see if we can
find any footprints,&rdquo; proposed Kent, and, going to
the back of the tool shed, they looked around. But
a mass of briar bushes grew close to the rear of the
small building, and they were unable to find any
clues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; Barry sighed. &ldquo;He has given
us the slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get inside,&rdquo; suggested Tim, who was feeling
the cold intensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you fellows aren&rsquo;t dressed for outdoors,&rdquo;
nodded Kent. &ldquo;And we are just about crazy to get
in around the fire. We&rsquo;ll have to give this up as a
bad job, for the time being anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>With some reluctance they left the vicinity of
the tool house and made their way around to the
front of the hunting lodge. The boys had left the
front door open in their haste, and the hall was
even colder than it had been. The twins led the way
into the living room of the lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Bluff Lodge!&rdquo; Mac cried, taking
the poker and beginning to stir the fire. Barry and
Kent spread grateful hands toward the blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coal on the fire!&rdquo; Barry exclaimed. &ldquo;Where
did that come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a coal shed back of the kitchen,&rdquo; Tim
explained. &ldquo;Feels good, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it!&rdquo; Kent and Barry ejaculated in chorus.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the half of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been out in the woods in all this storm?&rdquo; Mac
asked.</p>
<p>Barry nodded. &ldquo;Yes, we have been lost. Had to
leave the sled and find our way. It was a great idea
on the part of you fellows to put the lamp in the
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had any supper?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we had plenty. Built a fire and cooked
some steak,&rdquo; Kent told him. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d surely appreciate
a hot cup of coffee. How about you, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; his chum agreed. He began to
take off his outer clothes, shaking snow into the
fireplace. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got stories to swap. What was
that man doing besides thumping on the side of the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the coffee was preparing they sat close to
the fire and talked. The twins told their story first,
and the two who had been lost listened with close
attention. Then, while they all drank hot coffee,
Barry and Kent related the events of the day.</p>
<p>They had put the lamp out, and the fire glowed
red. A feeling of comfort and security settled over
them, in spite of the lurking presence of the one
who was seeking to annoy them. Although they
were tired they had too much to discuss to want to
go to bed at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t bring home Mac&rsquo;s hog grindings,&rdquo;
Tim grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were lucky to bring ourselves home,&rdquo; Kent
retorted. &ldquo;But we are sure that we know where the
sled is, and if the storm lets up tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll go
get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac went to the window and looked out, shielding
his eyes from the light of the fire. &ldquo;I believe
that the worst of it is over already,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;The flakes are coming down slowly.&rdquo; He turned
back and sat down in a wicker chair. &ldquo;We certainly
are glad to see you back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of this lodge was certainly a most
welcome one,&rdquo; grinned Barry. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t care
whether it was haunted or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked for a time and then sought their
beds. Kent and Barry were pleased at the change
of quarters. They lugged in the mattresses from the
beds in the cold bedrooms and placed them on the
floor. Mac selected the wide sofa for his resting
place, and when they had washed and were ready,
they stretched out on the mattresses with various
feelings of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was so tired,&rdquo; Kent yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about keeping guard?&rdquo; Tim suggested.
&ldquo;Suppose that thumping, knocking idiot comes
around again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear his thumping or knocking,&rdquo; Barry
predicted, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo; Kent said. &ldquo;Looks like you
Ford boys will have to do the chasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to chase him,&rdquo; Tim promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to stand guard,&rdquo; was Mac&rsquo;s
opinion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pretty light sleeper, and maybe
I&rsquo;ll wake up if anything goes wrong. We&rsquo;ll hope
he doesn&rsquo;t come back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little more was said, and the boys went to sleep,
thoroughly exhausted. They had not slept well
since coming to Lake Arrowtip, and there was no
guarantee that they would not be disturbed before
morning, but they went to sleep trusting that all
would be well. This time good fortune was on their
side, and they slept soundly until somewhat late in
the morning. The mattresses were soft and comfortable,
and the room was warm most of the night.
Barry was the first to awaken, and when he had
looked around and noted that his companions were
still asleep, he lowered his head and slept for another
half-hour.</p>
<p>Mac was the first to get up, and he looked at the
clock. &ldquo;Eight-thirty!&rdquo; he whistled. &ldquo;For the love
of Mike, what hardy campers we are!&rdquo; He reached
over and took the poker and proceeded to beat on
the side of the coal scuttle. &ldquo;Wake up, the enemy is
upon you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others quickly woke up and looked around
the room in some confusion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only
enemy we have!&rdquo; growled Kent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sign that you are a great man,&rdquo;
chuckled Mac. &ldquo;All great men have enemies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For breakfast they finished up the pork and
beans left from the previous night. Most of their
provisions were on the sled, and as soon as they had
set the lodge in order they prepared to set off for
the woods to find the missing vehicle. It had
stopped snowing sometime during the night, and
the sun was struggling to come out of the gray
clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the spook didn&rsquo;t come back last night,&rdquo;
Tim remarked, as they started out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he did, I didn&rsquo;t hear him,&rdquo; Barry declared.
&ldquo;I slept like a log the whole night. Not even a
dream disturbed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t quite as lucky as that,&rdquo; Kent told them.
&ldquo;I kept dreaming over and over again that I was
wandering around in circles. But I didn&rsquo;t hear anything,
not even Mac&rsquo;s snores!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t snore,&rdquo; retorted Mac. &ldquo;At least I&rsquo;ve
never heard myself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Barry and Kent were going by guesswork and at
first were unable to find the place where they had
left the sled, but just as they were becoming discouraged
Kent pointed off to the left. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
small bluff, and it looks like it might be the place,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was snowing so hard at the time that we
couldn&rsquo;t be certain of anything,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;But
that looks like the place. Yes, it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the sled still buried under the tree
limbs and bushes, but it was evident that some animal
had been scratching around in an effort to get
at it. &ldquo;Probably a fox,&rdquo; was Tim&rsquo;s guess. Nothing
had been disturbed, however, and they started back
to the lodge with the sled. As they came out of the
timber Mac pointed ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is standing close to the lodge,&rdquo; he
said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>They saw a man standing near the front porch,
looking around him as though in perplexity. He
was evidently a woodsman, and he held something
in his hand. Upon seeing the boys he hastened to
meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy-do,&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;Which one of you
boys is named Garrison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Barry informed him. The man held out
a letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter to you. I passed through Fox
Point this mornin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; down to the head
of the lake, so the storekeeper asked me to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot,&rdquo; Barry acknowledged, noting that
it was from his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, sure,&rdquo; the man replied, as he
turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop and have some dinner with us,&rdquo; Kent
called, but the man smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had mine already, thanks to you,&rdquo; he replied
and was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>Barry read his letter while the others were preparing
dinner, and his face was a study as he finished
it. &ldquo;No bad news, is there?&rdquo; Kent asked.</p>
<p>Barry shook his head. &ldquo;No, but my Dad says we
had better come on home. School starts again Tuesday,
and he thinks I ought to be home so as to get
ready to study for the next term. When he wrote
this, he hadn&rsquo;t received my letter, of course. I suppose
we&rsquo;ll have to go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others had stopped their preparations for
the noon meal and had clustered around. &ldquo;That
means go home tomorrow,&rdquo; Mac pointed out.</p>
<p>Barry nodded. &ldquo;Yes, it does. And I think we
ought to get up early and make our trip all in the
one day, instead of camping out overnight again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;It can be done easily enough,&rdquo; Kent agreed.
&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t realize that our time was up so
soon. We haven&rsquo;t solved our mystery, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what is bothering me,&rdquo; Barry
declared. &ldquo;We have been here long enough to have
the ghost or prowler make raps and knocks, and
then we have let him slip right out of our fingers.
It won&rsquo;t be easy to tell that to Dad, though I feel
sure that he&rsquo;ll understand that we did the best we
could. But it is a big disappointment to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really should have had more time on the
case,&rdquo; Tim said. &ldquo;Maybe something will happen
tonight and we can lay hands on the one we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our only hope,&rdquo; Kent declared. &ldquo;Something
must happen tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent the afternoon at the lodge, and for
supper Mac had his sausage. After supper they
chatted and enjoyed their last evening in the hunting
lodge. They arranged to take turns watching
through the night, and Barry took the first session.
While the others slept, he sat in a big chair back in
the shadows, his eyes and ears alert. Mac followed
him and then the others, but nothing amiss happened,
and when daylight came, they were forced
to realize that their last chance had passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, we&rsquo;ve failed,&rdquo; remarked Barry,
somewhat bitterly.</p>
<p>As soon as they had had breakfast they set the
lodge in order and then left it, making sure that
everything was in its place. At the edge of the lake
skates were strapped on, and they struck out
briskly. Before the sun had risen very high they
had entered the mouth of Buffalo and were going
downriver at a good pace. It was evident that they
would arrive in Cloverfield soon after dark. But
the thought did not make them as happy as it
should have. They were deeply disappointed at
their failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can come back in the summer and
camp there,&rdquo; Tim said, as they talked it over
around the fire of their noon camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summer is a long way off,&rdquo; declared Barry
gloomily. &ldquo;I wish we had landed him this time.
But I guess we lost our opportunity once and for
all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br />An Interview with a Client</h2>
<p>As the boys had calculated, they reached Cloverfield
well after dark. In discussing it at noontime,
they agreed not to pause for an evening meal,
but to push on and get home as soon as possible.
Accordingly, they kept up a fast pace, and had it
not been for frequent detours around snow-covered
places and logs, they would have made it by early
darkness. But as it was, they did well and saw the
lights of their home city before them at 7:30
o&rsquo;clock. By eight they had reached their homes,
and Barry went in after a few final words with
Kent. The light and warmth struck him pleasantly
as he stepped in the door.</p>
<p>His mother and sister were in the kitchen washing
and drying dishes, and his father was just coming
up from the cellar, where he had been putting
more coal on the furnace. They heard his footsteps
along the hall and greeted him eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know whether you would get in tonight
or tomorrow,&rdquo; his mother said, as she kissed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have your supper?&rdquo; Pearl asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
get you some if you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had any, Pearl, and I&rsquo;ll tell Mac
what a nice girl you are if you&rsquo;ll get me some,&rdquo;
Barry answered, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, get out!&rdquo; Pearl retorted, her cheeks flushing.
&ldquo;If you keep on talking that way, I won&rsquo;t do
anything for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got your letter, son,&rdquo; Mr. Garrison told him.
&ldquo;So you moved into the lodge when you found that
someone had been upstairs in the place. Have any
luck? Did you see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only luck we had was bad luck,&rdquo; Barry replied,
as he took off his coat and hat and hung his
skates in the cellar-way. &ldquo;We saw the spook and
thought we had him bottled up, but he got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried his father, in genuine astonishment.
His mother looked on in surprise, and Pearl
turned from the ice box to glance at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Barry! What did he look like?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;He looked just like a man, but we didn&rsquo;t see his
face,&rdquo; her brother informed her, as he washed his
hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it while I eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all so eager to hear his story that all
three of them fell to waiting on him, and while he
ate he told them the complete story of the black
shadow who had made the thumps and knocks. His
father listened with puckered brow and leaned forward
on the kitchen table in his eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you and Kent weren&rsquo;t lost in that
storm,&rdquo; his mother said, looking fondly at her
clean-cut, vigorous son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, I would have been scared to
death if I had seen that figure run along the side
of the lodge!&rdquo; Pearl declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barry, I think Mrs. Morganson ought to hear
that story,&rdquo; Mr. Garrison remarked. &ldquo;Feel like going
over to her house tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Dad, if you give me time to clean up
a bit. I&rsquo;m still dressed as a camper, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t bother Mrs. Morganson, but I agree
that you ought at least to change your shirt. You
do that as soon as you have finished, and I&rsquo;ll telephone
her and ask if we may come over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Barry nodded his agreement, and his father was
soon talking to his client over the wire. In a few
moments he came back, putting on his overcoat as
he came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she&rsquo;ll be glad to see us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
get the car out, and we&rsquo;ll go over as soon as you are
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry rose from the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a
couple of shakes, Dad.&rdquo; He raced up the front
stairs and before long was running down them
again, with a clean shirt and his hair neatly
combed. &ldquo;Did Dad come in?&rdquo; he asked his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s out front, sitting in the car and waiting
for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He had faith in you when
you said you&rsquo;d only be a couple of shakes. He
seemed to know what a shake is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just two shakes of a lamb&rsquo;s tail, Mother. Is that
all the time I took?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if the lambs shook them pretty slowly,&rdquo;
Mrs. Garrison smiled.</p>
<p>Barry trotted down the walk and got into the
car. &ldquo;All right, Dad, here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Mrs. Morganson lived on the other side of Cloverfield,
and after driving several blocks Mr. Garrison
brought the car to a stop in front of a fine old
white house that stood back among some magnificent
trees. As they opened the door to get out of the
car, the front door of the big house opened, and a
man came down the steps and approached them.
As the lamplight revealed him, Mr. Garrison murmured
his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brand Curry! I wonder.... Good-evening,
Mr. Curry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rather chunky individual merely grunted
and gave a short nod. He seemed out of humor and
would have passed on, but Barry&rsquo;s father hailed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Mr. Curry. Have you been in
to see Mrs. Morganson about the Bluff Lodge
proposition again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curry swung around and faced him abruptly.
&ldquo;It is none of your business what I went to see Mrs.
Morganson about, Mr. Garrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; the lawyer returned
evenly. &ldquo;If it was about that hunting lodge, it is my
business. But if you weren&rsquo;t talking about that, it
wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did go see Mrs. Morganson,&rdquo; the man admitted
defiantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just what I thought, Mr. Curry.
Why don&rsquo;t you come to me? I am her representative,
and she is not to be bothered with the details.
Why is it that you don&rsquo;t come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Garrison, this is a free country, and I go
where I like. I prefer to deal directly with Mrs.
Morganson, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it because you have no confidence in me, Mr.
Curry?&rdquo; Barry&rsquo;s father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my reasons, Mr. Garrison, and I will
keep them to myself. Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Curry walked away with dignity, and Mr.
Garrison shook his head in perplexity. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
hard man to deal with, and he never has been willing
to talk over this particular deal with me. He
didn&rsquo;t act very happy, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Barry chuckled. &ldquo;Maybe Mrs. Morganson
told him to go and see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; said Mr. Garrison, leading
the way into the house. At his knock a servant let
them in and showed them to a small private library
where Mrs. Morganson was reading. She welcomed
them with kindness, and they sat close to a
grate fire as they talked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you over the phone, Mrs. Morganson,
my son has something of importance to tell you
concerning Bluff Lodge,&rdquo; Mr. Garrison began.
&ldquo;He and three of his friends have been camping
up on Arrowtip, and he learned some interesting
things. The last two days that they were at the
lake, they camped in the lodge itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morganson looked with interest at Barry,
and her words were a distinct surprise. &ldquo;I know
that he and his friends have been camping in the
lodge,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Brand Curry has just been
here to protest about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br />An Unexpected Event</h2>
<p>Barry and his father exchanged glances. &ldquo;To
protest about it!&rdquo; Mr. Garrison cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the lady nodded. &ldquo;He said that it lowered
the value of the place to allow boys to camp there.
He seemed quite annoyed about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he know that we were there?&rdquo;
Barry inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that someone who knew the place had
been up there lately and saw the boys in the lodge.
I asked him if they had done anything to hurt the
place, and he said no, but that he thought it was
wrong to allow boys to camp there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he certainly has a nerve!&rdquo; said Mr. Garrison.
&ldquo;That property doesn&rsquo;t belong to him, and
he has nothing to say as to what shall be done with
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants it badly enough and as good as told
me tonight that he will have it,&rdquo; Mrs. Morganson
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very discourteous about it all,&rdquo; frowned
Barry&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;I stopped him tonight and asked
him why he does not come to me. He said it is a
free country and he prefers to go to you directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morganson smiled a quiet smile. &ldquo;Probably
he thinks he can win me over, or even scare me.
He is offering a very low price for the lodge, and
I am not going to sell it at his figure. He knows the
value of the property and could make a lot out of
it, but I am not going to give my hunting lodge
away. Now I&rsquo;d like to hear Barry&rsquo;s story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry told the owner of the hunting lodge what
had happened while they had camped at Lake Arrowtip.
&ldquo;The only thing that we regret,&rdquo; he finished,
&ldquo;is the fact that we did not catch the man
after we saw him go into the tool shed. We feel that
if we could have had a few days longer, we would
have learned the secret of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad that your short vacation came to
an end when it did,&rdquo; acknowledged the lady. &ldquo;But
I think you did a fine bit of work as it is. Of course,
I have believed all along that some human being is
doing this unpleasantness, and not any ghostly being.
The mystery is, who is doing it and why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that Mr. Brand Curry is doing
it to lower the value of the lodge?&rdquo; Barry asked
slowly. Mrs. Morganson smiled at his father as she
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father and I have wondered about that,
but we do not believe that it is so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr.
Curry is always here in town, and we cannot believe
that the lodge is so dear to him that he keeps
a sort of scare agent up there all the time. Just as
soon as any party goes into the lodge, either in winter
or summer, the annoyances begin. That would
seem to indicate that whoever does it lives close by
there all the time. We know that Mr. Curry is anxious
to have the place, but so are three other business
men who are offering better prices than Mr.
Curry is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all mighty queer,&rdquo; Barry murmured.
&ldquo;Have you ever heard from your nephew since the
letter came from Canada?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have reason to believe that he is now in
South America,&rdquo; Mrs. Morganson said. &ldquo;I believe
that he was taken away from my property because
he had discovered something that certain parties
do not want known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a Frenchman who disappeared at
the same time,&rdquo; Barry pressed. &ldquo;What of him?
Was he married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was married, and his wife was also
working at the lodge when her husband left. Nothing
has ever been heard of them since that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For another half-hour they talked of the mystery,
and then Barry and his father left. Nothing
definite had been agreed to, though Mr. Garrison
had expressed a desire to make a trip to Arrowtip
himself and spend a night or two in the lodge
alone. But Mrs. Morganson was not in favor of
the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us wait until spring comes before we do
anything else,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;It is so cold and disagreeable
now. I will not rent it to anyone from now
on, and when the warm weather comes we can have
some more private detectives put on the case. Let&rsquo;s
not worry about it until later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry and his father went home and talked over
the situation at length, and it was agreed between
them that when spring came they would go to the
lake, together with the other boys, and have another
opportunity to match wits with the disturbing
element of the hunting lodge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>School was not to begin before Tuesday, and on
Monday morning Barry stood at the general desk
in the local post office, writing out a card. No one
else was in the place at the time except the two
clerks back of the windows. While Barry was
busily engaged, the door opened and a schoolmate
named Charlie Black came in. He was a short, energetic
young fellow with glasses and shrewd,
laughing eyes, a great favorite at the high school,
where he led in debates and any form of public
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, little fellow!&rdquo; Barry greeted, using the
name most frequently applied to young Mr. Black.
&ldquo;Looking for a letter from your girl friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, mystery hunter! No, I&rsquo;m going to buy
some stamps.&rdquo; This having been taken care of,
Charlie approached the desk and leaned on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I have some news that will knock your eye
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell it to me then, because I need all my
eyes. You ought not go around with such dangerous
news,&rdquo; Barry grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Barry, this is great news. No fooling!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why keep it to yourself? Let&rsquo;s have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No school for about ten days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big flue from the furnace burned out, and they
have to have a special new one made. Hurrah,
what luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry shook his head in pretended disgust. &ldquo;It is
plain to see that you&rsquo;ll never amount to anything.
Rejoicing because your opportunity to learn something
is cut off. Your lack of wholesome ambition
is pitiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, listen, plaster saint, you&rsquo;re just as tickled
as I am! The difference between us is that I&rsquo;m honest!
Say, I have some more news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, you&rsquo;ve got enough of it in you to
explode! Get it out quick. What else happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing yet, but it is going to happen. As soon
as I heard that there wasn&rsquo;t going to be any school
for a while I thought it would be a dandy idea to
have a straw ride. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean hire a truck or wagon and a bunch
of fellows and girls and go for a straw ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. How else would you go on a straw ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will we go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, but maybe to Potter&rsquo;s Mill or
some place where we can build a fire and cook
some supper and then we&rsquo;ll come on home. It&rsquo;s a
lot of fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ve been on one before, only it was in
the summer and not in the winter. What&rsquo;s the matter
with getting about three or four sleighs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea. Will you and Kent and the
twins come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. When are you going to have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we can. I&rsquo;ve talked to a few seniors
about it, and they are willing. Well, I must get on.
I&rsquo;m chairman, and of course that means all the
work falls on me. Funny name, chairman, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the chairman never gets a chance to sit
down, and he doesn&rsquo;t need a chair! Ought to call
him something else. I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Barry requested. &ldquo;Who made
you chairman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I did!&rdquo; was the unblushing answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought, popgun! Go ahead and
do your organizing and we&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, be careful crossing corners!&rdquo; grinned
the energetic Charlie Black as he fairly dashed out
of the post office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Barry followed more slowly, and as he strolled
along the street his mind was busy with the contemplated
straw ride and the mystery at Lake Arrowtip.
At last he came to a stop, and his face
brightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly changing his course, he turned down
a side street and was soon going up the walk to the
home of Mrs. Morganson. He was readily admitted,
and the lady received him in the parlor. Barry
rapidly told her about the plans for the straw ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want to ask you in particular, Mrs.
Morganson, is this: may we ride up to the lodge
and have our gathering there? I will personally
guarantee that we will treat the place well, and it
would not suffer any from our visit, and Coach
Jordan and Mrs. Jordan will be with us, I&rsquo;m sure.
I think it would be a splendid place for us to have
supper, and we could spend the night there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not in the least afraid that you would
damage the lodge,&rdquo; Mrs. Morganson smiled. &ldquo;Are
you sure Coach and Mrs. Jordan will go with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, Coach Jordan and his wife always
go with us, and I guess they will this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, you may use the lodge if they do,&rdquo;
Mrs. Morganson granted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just hoping you
won&rsquo;t have any trouble with that unknown person
that you saw the last time you were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think we will,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;But if we
do, Kent and the twins and I will be on the lookout,
and perhaps we can learn something more
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Barry was on his way home,
his mind busy with new thoughts and ideas. He
was in a hurry to hunt up his chums and tell them
of the latest events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be the very chance we have been looking
for,&rdquo; he reflected, as he walked briskly along.
&ldquo;The man always starts something when a crowd
gathers in the lodge, and we&rsquo;ll be there all night,
if the bunch will agree to go to Lake Arrowtip.
The four of us will be on the lookout for any such
visit. I hope this will all work out as I want it to!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br />The Straw Ride</h2>
<p>After dinner that day Barry hunted up Kent and
the twins and told them what he had in mind. They
fell in readily with his plan and were enthusiastic
regarding the delay in the opening of school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we didn&rsquo;t know that before we came
home,&rdquo; Tim remarked. &ldquo;We could have stayed on,
and perhaps we would have run down the evil
spirit of the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;But this is the
next best thing. As a matter of fact, it may work
out better. Every time that a crowd goes to the
lodge, something happens, and we may make the
spook play right into our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking quite a chance,&rdquo; Kent shook his
head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wondering if the prowler comes
out on the first night or if he waits for the second
or third. We may not be troubled in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is a long chance,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;But
we won&rsquo;t lose anything if nothing happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say we ought to stay overnight,&rdquo; Mac
spoke up. &ldquo;Will the bunch do it? They may not
want to go to Bluff Lodge in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see Charlie Black and try and
make him enthusiastic,&rdquo; Barry smiled. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll
get the others in the same frame of mind. I think
we can work it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His chums having agreed to the program, Barry
went to the home of the dashing Charlie, whom he
found in his den. The popular high-school debater
was practising on a cornet when Barry entered the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; greeted the cornetist, hastily lowering the
shining instrument. &ldquo;Come in! But as the sign over
the doorway to the lower regions says, &lsquo;Abandon
hope, all ye that enter here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve abandoned all hope of hearing any real
music,&rdquo; Barry grinned. &ldquo;What are you trying to
blow that thing for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music,&rdquo; was the brisk answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty good at chin music,&rdquo; Barry replied.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you want to blow a horn.
But that is neither here nor there. I came to see
you about our straw ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cornet was tossed with unerring aim into a
waste basket, where a pile of crumpled paper
broke its fall. Charlie spun fully around in his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Fifteen of us are going, counting you
and Kent and the Ford boys. There may be others,
too. I&rsquo;ll see Coach and Mrs. Jordan tonight and
see if they&rsquo;ll go along. How&rsquo;s that for progress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Barry admitted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great
organizer, Charlie. Where are we going on this
ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have Potter&rsquo;s Mill in mind. What do you
think?&mdash;Oh, that&rsquo;s my dog. I call him Castor Oil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large, flop-eared animal had come bounding
into the den and jumped up on the leather couch
where Barry was sitting. Before the boy could
move, the dog had shot out a big red tongue and
licked his face. Barry ducked and hastily brushed
his hand over his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get down, Castor!&rdquo; commanded Charlie,
sternly, and the dog obeyed in a clumsy manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call him Castor Oil for?&rdquo; Barry
demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is a big nuisance, follows me around
and jumps on people. He&rsquo;s about as welcome as
Castor Oil. I don&rsquo;t like to take him places. One
day I was thinking up a name for him, and at the
same time I was thinking that I didn&rsquo;t like to take
him around with me. I tried to think of something
else I don&rsquo;t like to take, and then the name just
came by itself, somehow. Good name, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, about the kind of name I&rsquo;d expect you
to give,&rdquo; grunted Barry. &ldquo;But to get back to business,
how about taking our party up to Bluff
Lodge, on Lake Arrowtip? It is a dandy place,
and we could stay all night. I got permission from
Mrs. Morganson to use the lodge, if we want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! That&rsquo;s the haunted house, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the four of us camped in it a few days,
and there is nothing the matter with us,&rdquo; Barry replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a good place to go,&rdquo; Charlie
nodded, gently pulling the big ears of the dog with
the questionable name. &ldquo;What kind of a looking
place is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Barry described the lodge to him, and Charlie
was enthusiastic. &ldquo;Say, that will be a dandy place.
Fireplaces and stoves and bedrooms and all. But
we&rsquo;d have to stay overnight, wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we wouldn&rsquo;t mind that. Coach and
Mrs. Jordan will be along, and there is plenty of
room for us all. We can take enough for our supper
and breakfast the following morning. How are
you going to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sleighs,&rdquo; Charlie returned. &ldquo;It is an easy
matter to get hold of sleighs. Of course, it isn&rsquo;t
much of a straw ride when you take it in a sleigh.
I&rsquo;ve always thought of a straw or a hay ride as one
where you go in a truck or a big wagon, with straw
on the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;As
far as that goes, we can put straw on the bottom of
the sleighs. So you agree to the lodge proposition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing! You ask all of them you see if
they&rsquo;ll stay overnight, and I&rsquo;ll do the same. We&rsquo;ll
make this a dandy outing. Say, want to hear a little
music on my new cornet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. My nerves are in pretty good order
today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Castor Oil&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Charlie, as he took
the instrument from the waste basket. &ldquo;He howls
every time I go at it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>After leaving Charlie Black&rsquo;s house Barry
started home, intending to stop and see some of the
boys who were going on the ride. As he came to a
certain corner he heard the noise of an oncoming
car, and as it was traveling at a fast pace, he paused
on the curbing and let it rush past him. Glancing at
the driver, he saw that it was Carter Wolf and
one companion. They looked at him, but nothing
was said, and the car passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is back from Rake Island,&rdquo; Barry reflected,
as he went on.</p>
<p>That night at the supper table Pearl spoke about
the contemplated trip. &ldquo;I hear that we are going
to stay overnight at Bluff Lodge, Barry. Did you
plan that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her brother nodded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that
anyone except seniors were going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a few,&rdquo; Pearl answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of the
lucky ones. I hope we don&rsquo;t see that black shadow
or anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the idea of going up there, son?&rdquo; Mr.
Garrison asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two reasons, Dad,&rdquo; his son replied. &ldquo;One is
that the place is ideal for an overnight trip, and
another is that we hope to draw the man out and
perhaps get a chance to nail him. The twins and
Kent and I will be on the lookout.&rdquo; He turned to
his sister. &ldquo;Pearl, please don&rsquo;t tell anyone about
that black shadow or anything else. We want the
whole thing kept absolutely quiet so that we can do
something if we get the opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t breathe a word, Barry, and I&rsquo;ll even try
not to look scared,&rdquo; his sister promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big job for you boys.&rdquo; Mr. Garrison
shook his head, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll get hurt,&rdquo; his mother worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; was Barry&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;After all,
nothing may happen. No one may come around.
Besides that, Coach Jordan will be with us, and so
will a number of the other fellows, so we ought not
to have any difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plans for the straw ride went forward in a satisfactory
manner. Charlie Black took it upon himself
to see everyone who could possibly go from the
upper class, and in the end sixteen of the young
people of Cloverfield High School consented to
go and spend a night at Bluff Lodge. Of these sixteen,
nine were girls and seven of them boys. The
other two members of the sleigh party were the
popular football coach and his wife, both of whom
were young and in sympathy with the fun of the
young people. It had been agreed that each one
was to bring a certain item of the provisions to be
used on the trip, and at last everything was in
readiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>On the night before they were to start, the four
chums attended a motion-picture show, and when
they came out they were surprised to see that it
was snowing. They halted outside the bulk of the
crowd and waited for Charlie to join them. They
had seen him wave from the steps of the theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little chairman wants us,&rdquo; Kent remarked.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he has in mind now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This snow will make our trip a pretty one, if it
doesn&rsquo;t get too deep,&rdquo; Barry said, as they waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t turn into a blizzard,&rdquo; Tim felt sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all that arm-waving about?&rdquo; Mac
asked Charlie as he joined the group.</p>
<p>Charlie looked all around them in a mysterious
way. &ldquo;Have you fellows heard anything?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a whole lot of things, but maybe
not what you mean,&rdquo; smiled Barry. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I heard that Carter Wolf and his crowd
are going to try and break into our party, or break
it up, or something. You know, there has been a lot
of talking about our trip, and he heard it. He says
he and some friends were shot at one night near
that lodge, and that you fellows know very well
that it is haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, we&rsquo;re not afraid to go up there,&rdquo;
Kent replied. &ldquo;Somebody did shoot at him near the
lodge, but it wasn&rsquo;t us. I hope he doesn&rsquo;t spoil our
party by scaring any of the fellows or girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t scare them,&rdquo; Charlie cried. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
only want to go all the more. But we had better
keep our eyes open for any monkey business from
Wolf and some of his bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Barry promised.</p>
<p>On the following day the straw-ride party
started for Bluff Lodge. The sleighs all came together
at Kent&rsquo;s house, and after they were all in
their places, the procession started. In the foremost
sled sat the chairman, and beside him, between
Charlie and Barry, Castor Oil reared his big head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t keep him at home,&rdquo; Charlie explained.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to take him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>It was a fairly long journey to the lodge, and so
they started at noontime. By road it was much
shorter than by going up the river. It was a clear,
cold day, and they enjoyed the swift motion of the
sleighs. Talk and laughter ran high, and they
called jokingly from sled to sled. It was late in the
afternoon and dusk was just spreading across the
lake country when they emerged from the timber
and came in sight of the lodge building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, we&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; shouted Charlie, thumping
Castor Oil, who barked in protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is the haunted lodge?&rdquo; a girl in the second
sled cried. &ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;ll see the ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br />Barry&rsquo;s Great Discovery</h2>
<p>Barry jumped from the sled and took out the
keys while the others were dismounting from the
sleighs. Tim and Mac lifted a large oil can from
the vehicle they had come in. The others stood in
the snow and stamped their feet, glad to move
about once more after sitting so long. Coach Jordan
helped some of the boys tie the horses to the
back-porch rail.</p>
<p>The sun had gone down in an angry red haze,
and the darkness was spreading rapidly, accompanied
by a cold that nipped and penetrated them.
Although they knew that the lodge would be cold,
the visitors were glad to follow Barry and the twins
inside. Kent made a quick trip around the big log
building to see if everything was all right, and he
returned satisfied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The twins lighted the lamps that were already in
the big living room, and in the meantime Barry
collected some wood, soaked it with oil, and
touched the flame of a match to it. After the flames
were leaping up the chimney he got some coal and
put it on the burning wood. The room began to get
warm slowly.</p>
<p>The girls and boys roamed around admiring the
place, and at last they began to take off coats and
hats as the room warmed up. From the living room
Kent and Barry moved into the two bedrooms and
lighted fires in them, so that they would be able
to stay there all night without discomfort. Soon
the grates in those rooms were glowing and the
lodge had become comfortable. They decided to
do their cooking in the kitchen, and accordingly a
fire was kindled in the big range there. This was
something more of a task because the stove was
rusty and clogged with ashes and tin cans, left by
some careless and untidy campers. The boys
cleaned the stove out, and after this was done, the
fire burned well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Some of them favored using the dining room,
but the majority vote was that they eat in the living
room, by the light and warmth of the large
grate there. All of them were hungry, and so the
girls took charge of the supper preparation under
the expert leadership of Mrs. Jordan. The boys sat
in the living room with the coach and chatted about
winter sports. In a very short time the delightful
smell of things cooking reached them. The coach
smiled as he heard the murmurs of appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tempting smell, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This
Lake Arrowtip air is a great hunger-producing
tonic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found it that way,&rdquo; Tim grinned.</p>
<p>Charlie was seldom able to sit still long at a
time, and he bounded off to the kitchen, followed
by the faithful Castor Oil. Before long he was
back, rigged out in an apron and a paper hat, obviously
in the capacity of a waiter. Disregarding the
jokes of the boys, he began to set things in order
for supper.</p>
<p>It seemed to the hungry boys that the meal was
a long time coming, but the girls declared with
spirit that it hadn&rsquo;t taken much time except to
those who sat around waiting for it. The time finally
came when they were all sitting close to the
fire eating steak and potatoes, talking and enjoying
themselves. All lamps had been put out, and
only the red glow of the fire illuminated the room.
But by this time the fire was a solid mass of glowing
coals, and a sufficient light was rendered for
all. Their shadows clustered on the wall back of
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you four boys camped here for a few days,
just like this?&rdquo; a senior girl asked the four chums.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it delightful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We enjoyed it,&rdquo; Kent nodded. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t
here all the time, though. At first we camped over
in that smaller cabin that you could see as we drove
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you leave it?&rdquo; Mrs. Jordan asked.</p>
<p>This was getting close to things that the boys did
not want to reveal, but before Kent could answer,
Barry broke in. &ldquo;That little cabin was cold, and
the floor was hard to sleep on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then one
night a limb dropped on the roof and scared us
quite a bit, so we decided to move in here. Tim and
Mac did the moving, and Kent and I got lost in a
storm that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about all the ghost stories we hear?&rdquo;
another girl asked. &ldquo;Is there a ghost around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty cold for a ghost,&rdquo; Barry smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been here two hours or more and haven&rsquo;t heard
anything yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said another girl, looking
around the room uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all right,&rdquo; Charlie Black assured her.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let Castor Oil loose all night and he&rsquo;ll sic
the ghost. He&rsquo;s a fine sic-er!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spook will run if he ever finds out the
dog&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; said Mac, amid a general laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach, how about telling us a good ghost story
tonight?&rdquo; Bill Jefferson asked. &ldquo;The atmosphere is
just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The atmosphere is all right,&rdquo; the athletic instructor
smiled. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid of some nerves
around here. I know a ghost story wouldn&rsquo;t bother
the boys, but I don&rsquo;t want to upset the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girls themselves begged him to tell at
least one after the meal was over, and at length he
agreed to do so. Coach Jordan was a good story
teller, and many times he had spun some lively
yarns while on overnight hikes with the boys of
Cloverfield. He excelled in creepy mystery stories,
and the young people looked forward with eager
anticipation to a good one after supper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about some boy volunteers to dry dishes?&rdquo;
Pearl asked, as they got up to carry plates back to
the kitchen. &ldquo;We did all the work of preparing
supper. I know that most of you boys camp out, so
you must know how to wash and dry dishes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about letting Castor Oil lick all the plates
and then drying them over the stove?&rdquo; Charlie
shouted, but an indignant chorus of voices answered
him, and he went off chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, the men will take charge of the kitchen
from now on,&rdquo; cried Coach Jordan. &ldquo;No
ladies allowed out there except to bring your
plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; commended Ruth Carrier,
the leader among the high-school girls. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
start to toast some marshmallows for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreeable all around,&rdquo; Kent nodded, and the
boys took over the kitchen work, while the girls
went back to the living room to toast the marshmallows.</p>
<p>Mr. Jordan and Kent did the washing, and the
other boys dried the dishes. After a time they
looked around for a pail to put scraps in, but there
was none in the kitchen. Barry seized a lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I remember seeing one in the tool
house,&rdquo; he said, as he opened the back door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The horses tied to the rail of the porch moved
restlessly as he passed by them on his way across the
board platform. Fodder had been brought for
them, and as soon as the dishes were dried the boys
planned to move the horses to a big shed back of
the lodge which served as a combination barn and
garage. Barry arrived at the tool house and went
inside, peering around in the feeble light from the
lamp. At the far end of the place he saw a tin can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is. I thought I remembered seeing it
in here. This is just&mdash;&mdash; Ouch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had tripped on something, and he flashed
the light down to see what it was. He was close beside
the bale of hay that stood there, and as he examined
the floor he saw that it was slightly raised.
This interested him, and he put his hand down
and pulled the raised boards toward him. To his
surprise several of them came up a few inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens is this? Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a single motion of his arm he pushed the
bale of hay aside and stared at the floor. A long
trapdoor was revealed, and with trembling fingers
he raised it, looking down into a deep well of darkness.
A pair of wooden stairs ran down to the floor
of a passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;An underground passage!&rdquo; Barry breathed.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m beginning to see a few things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several seconds he stood staring down into
the tunnel, remembering how the black shadow
had disappeared from the interior of the shed.
Many conflicting thoughts crowded his mind, and
his impulse was to go down and explore the passageway.
But the severe cold made him think better
of it, and, closing the trap and replacing the
hay, he picked up the tin container he had come
to get and went back to the lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my hat and coat on and get some of the
boys to go with me,&rdquo; he thought, as he opened the
kitchen door and went in.</p>
<p>Coach Jordan and his helpers were nearly finished.
Barry left the can and went into the living
room, picking up his coat and hat. Kent and the
twins were not around at the time, and so Barry
slipped out of the front door alone. His chums
were in the bedroom attending to the fire there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take a peek along that corridor myself,&rdquo;
he decided, feeling in his pocket for his flashlight
and noting with satisfaction that it was there.
&ldquo;Then maybe I&rsquo;ll take the whole crowd for a tour
of it, providing it is safe to do so!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Arriving once more in the tool house, he moved
the bale of hay aside and raised the trapdoor, listening
keenly before making a descent into the
newly found passage. No sound came to him as he
stood in perfect silence, and at last, thinking that
it was safe to proceed, he turned on the beam of his
light and carefully walked down the steps. There
were seven steps, and when he reached the bottom
he turned the light down the tunnel. He had closed
the door of the opening and now stood alone under
the earth.</p>
<p>The passage was long and sloped away farther
than the shaft of light would reveal. With a rapidly
beating heart he began to advance, walking
slowly and quietly, his eyes alert and his nerves
drawn tight. The thought came to him that he was
drawing farther and farther away from his companions
and that he ought to go back and get some
of them, but the impulse to go on was too strong,
and he kept advancing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>The tunnel was well made. He was able to walk
upright and had to bend low only at one place
where a tree root broke through and crossed the
underground way. It was a dry place and not very
cold. The sides of the tunnel had been carefully
cut, and it seemed to him that it had been built for
some definite purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can it be for?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;Does
Mrs. Morganson know that it is here? Maybe I&rsquo;ll
know more about it all when I get to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end was near. He could see some boards before
him, and a few moments later he stopped,
playing the beam of the light against the boards
that closed the tunnel. They seemed to be fairly
new ones, and they simply fitted into the soil. He
put out his hand to push against them and then
thought better of it, pausing to listen once more, his
flashlight out. The blackness seemed to crush in on
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No telling what is on the other side of that
boarding. If I can&rsquo;t push it open, I&rsquo;ll go back and
get the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sound came to him, and so he again turned
on the light and then pushed against the partition.
To his astonishment it turned outward like a door,
and his light showed him the interior of a small
shed. Stepping through and closing the boards
after him, he was surprised to see that it was on
hinges and formed part of the wall of the small
building in which he found himself. There were
two windows and a door to the place, but otherwise
the interior was perfectly bare. A conviction
came to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;By George, this is the quarry shed where Kent
and I saw the man with the black gloves go in! No
wonder no one answered our knocks and kicks. The
man had gone up the tunnel to the lodge, and when
we got over that way, we saw him run into the tool
house! I&rsquo;m learning so much that it makes me
dizzy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door of the quarry shed and
stepped out. The wind, coming in from a break in
the rock wall, had swept the snow away from the
door, and the ground was hard and the snow at
that particular place hard-packed. He closed the
door and looked around. It was much the same as
it had been the night he and Kent had stood there
demanding shelter, except that the snow was not
driving. He wondered where the black shadow
came from, and he began to wander toward the far
end of the quarry. For a while he did not use his
light, and it was not until he was at the very base
of the quarry wall that he flashed the light around.
There was nothing to be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;No house or anything down at this end,&rdquo; he reflected,
turning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his eyes fell on a figure crossing the bowl
of the quarry, and instinctively he crouched down.
It was the same black-clothed figure that they had
seen once before, and the man went boldly into the
quarry shed. Barry watched him with wildly beating
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes now!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;On his way
to the lodge to start something, I&rsquo;ll bet! And as
sure as I&rsquo;m a foot high, he&rsquo;ll discover that someone
has been in his tunnel! Then what will happen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br />The Raiders</h2>
<p>The boys who remained in the kitchen helping
Coach Jordan with the dishes were not long in finishing
the job. Kent and the coach did the washing,
and as fast as they turned out the dripping,
steaming plates, the other boys snatched them up
and dried them. There was a lot of good-natured
fun about it all, and it was plainly to be seen that
the boys from Cloverfield were enjoying the whole
trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Coach Jordan kept them interested by his description
of his travels and experiences, and at the
time that Barry left the room on his way to the tool
house he was telling of the days when he was a
member of the great Fordson camp in the mountains
of Kentucky. His account of the road-building
and forest-ranging in the dense timber of the
Southern upland was of great interest to the boys,
and they laughed heartily at some of the rough experiences
that he had encountered while staying in
mountain log cabins and having to get up at three
o&rsquo;clock and shave with well water on frosty mornings.
He told them of the great salt kettles rusting
away in the mud of the little town that was at the
time the shipping point for the Ford lumber and
coal, a town which had at one time supplied all of
the blue-grass state with salt. The boys listened
with great attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between those mountains
and these?&rdquo; Tom Bailey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These mountains are pretty well known,&rdquo; the
coach replied. &ldquo;The people in them have been in
contact with civilization for a long time, and tourist
and the summer camper have come into them
frequently. But in the Kentucky mountains we find
an arrested civilization, and by that I mean that
people poured into its hollows and gaps and then
progress jumped clear over them and kept going
west, while the mountaineer remained the same as
he had been in the time of the Revolution. I have
frequently seen old mountain women working the
old-time spinning wheel, and many of them smoke
a pipe all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Kent had finished his work, and after drying his
hands he went into the nearest bedroom to see how
the fire was. Finding that it needed coal, he seized
a bucket and flashlight and went out to get some.
When he returned he met the twins in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; Mac exclaimed. &ldquo;We were
wondering what had become of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just lugging in some coal,&rdquo; Kent explained.
He entered the bedroom and began to fix the fire.
&ldquo;What are the girls doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have toasted some marshmallows that
melt right in your mouth,&rdquo; Tim replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you want &rsquo;em to melt. Sounds like
you have had some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; Mac admitted. &ldquo;Now that the dishes
are done, we can all have some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Barry?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kent answered, straightening
up. &ldquo;The last I saw of him, he had gone out to the
tool house to get a pail. I suppose he is in the kitchen
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if anything will happen tonight,&rdquo;
Mac said, in a low tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but we are going to keep our ears
and eyes open,&rdquo; Kent told him. &ldquo;If anything does
happen, we want to be on the job. Well, let&rsquo;s get
back in the living room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found all the young people gathered
around the fire, and Coach Jordan and Bill Jefferson
were taking off their hats and coats. &ldquo;We put
the horses in the barn,&rdquo; the coach explained. Then
he rubbed his hands and held them close to the fire.
&ldquo;After being out there, this heat feels good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kent and the twins looked around the room.
&ldquo;Anybody seen Barry?&rdquo; Kent asked.</p>
<p>Everyone looked around, and then one by one
they shook their heads. &ldquo;He brought that pail in
and then left the kitchen,&rdquo; Charlie announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came in here and took his hat and coat,&rdquo; one
of the girls remarked. &ldquo;Then he went out into that
hall toward the front door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twins exchanged troubled glances, and Kent
glanced involuntarily at Pearl, who looked suddenly
alarmed. &ldquo;Too bad Pearl knows anything
about this place,&rdquo; Kent thought. But he spoke carelessly:
&ldquo;Oh, well, he&rsquo;ll be right back. Let&rsquo;s have
some of those marshmallows. What happened to
those black ones?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fell in the fire,&rdquo; Jennie Morrison explained.
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll taste just as good as the others. They
are just like some people, rough outside and sweet
inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jennie is becoming quite a philosopher,&rdquo;
laughed Mrs. Jordan. &ldquo;Tell us some more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;I can toast marshmallows
better than I can give you philosophy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The talking went on in a good-natured way, but
not all of them were joining in it. The three mystery
hunters were quiet, and Pearl frequently
looked at Mac, and she was plainly uneasy. Finally
Mac leaned over to Tim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I don&rsquo;t like the looks of things,&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;Barry has been gone a long time. Suppose
you go into the kitchen and look around. If
you don&rsquo;t see anything, I&rsquo;ll go out on the front
porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What excuse will I give for going out?&rdquo; Tim
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need&mdash;well, there isn&rsquo;t any water in
here, and there is some in the kitchen. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim nodded and got up from the footstool upon
which he had been sitting. &ldquo;These marshmallows
are powerful sweet,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get
a pitcher of water and some glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; the coach approved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Tim took his flashlight and hurried to the kitchen.
They had brought some large containers of
drinking water with them, and just now this afforded
him a convenient excuse for leaving. But
as soon as he arrived in the kitchen he put out the
light and walked across the room to the back door.
He turned the key and looked out.</p>
<p>All was quiet, and no one was around. He
walked out on the porch and looked around the
open clearing. The night was fairly dark, but because
of the bright blanket of snow he was able to
make out near-by objects. Barry was nowhere to
be seen. Tim returned to the house, locked the kitchen
door, and proceeded to pour some water in a
pitcher by the light of his flash. When he had obtained
some glasses he went back to the living
room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jordan was reciting a humorous poem, and
most of them paid little or no attention to Tim as
he came back. But Pearl scanned his averted face
anxiously and saw at once that he had not found
her brother. Mac and Kent read the same answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Nothing was said, and at last Mac began to work
his way toward the hall door. Tim had passed him
the flashlight, and with this in his back pocket he
gradually moved over to the door that led into the
front room. While the others were busy laughing
at a joke that Charlie had told, Mac slipped out of
the door. Few of them saw him go, and no one
asked any questions.</p>
<p>As soon as he got into the big square hall Mac
turned on the beam of the light and hastily played
it all around the box-like place. Barry was not
there, and for a moment Mac trained the light on
the stairs leading to the loft. He wondered if his
chum had gone up there, but at last he shook his
head. The popular leader of Cloverfield High
School had put on his hat and coat, and that clearly
indicated that he had gone out-of-doors. For a moment
Mac hesitated. He was not prepared to go out
into the snow, and to go back and get his outer
clothing would excite suspicion at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;the bunch is soon going
to know that Barry has disappeared. If he
doesn&rsquo;t get back soon, we&rsquo;ll have to go and look for
him. We can&rsquo;t fool them much longer. Pearl is
getting more and more uneasy every minute. Hang
it all, maybe we&rsquo;re wasting valuable time. I&rsquo;ll look
outside, and if I don&rsquo;t see him, I&rsquo;m going back and
get my hat and coat and go out and hunt for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>He stepped out onto the front porch and walked
to the edge, looking around toward the back of the
lodge. No one was in sight, and then he glanced
out over the lake, dim in the light of the stars and
the white border of the dark timbered sides. At
once his eyes narrowed as he saw signs of movement
on the ice sheet of the lake. Something bulky
and black shot out onto the ice, and two figures
leaped from it and began to push it ahead of them.
As Mac stared without comprehension, another
bulky object shot out from the bank onto the ice.
The Ford boy gasped and clenched his fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our sleighs! Somebody is shoving them out onto
the lake! Of all the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice, low-pitched and yet penetrating,
reached him, coming in from the lake. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send
the other one down until I tell you! I want to get
this one out of the way first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great light dawned upon Mac. &ldquo;Carter Wolf
and his gang!&rdquo; he breathed, as he turned and raced
softly back to the front door. &ldquo;Running off with
our sleighs! Going to hide them so we&rsquo;ll have to
hike home! We&rsquo;ve got to put a stop to that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>Throwing all caution to the winds, the twin
rushed through the hall and flung himself into the
living room, startling them all and very nearly
knocking one girl over. His staring eyes and excited
manner alarmed them all and caused particular
apprehension on the part of those who
knew anything about the history of Bluff Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said, before anyone could speak.
&ldquo;Somebody is pushing our sleighs out on the ice
and taking them off to hide them. I&rsquo;m sure it is
Carter Wolf and his bunch! If we don&rsquo;t want to
walk home tomorrow, we&rsquo;d better get out there in
a big hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A medley of cries of surprise and indignation
came in answer to his rapid announcement, and
everyone sprang up in consternation. Coach Jordan
seized his coat and hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have something
to say about this!&rdquo; He turned to his wife.
&ldquo;You take care of the girls, Dorothy. Better not go
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were ready, and like a pack of hornets
they dashed out of the front door on the heels of
Coach Jordan. Kent sprinted in the lead because
he knew the country better, and he led them across
the clearing toward the Bronson cabin. They had
left the sleds in front of that building when they
had tied the horses to the back-porch rail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>All of the sleighs were gone, and Mac led them
down the slope toward where he had seen the
sleighs slide out on the ice. They expected to find
the vehicles scattered and the raiders gone. But to
their astonishment they heard voices and saw a
dark mass at the edge of the lake shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep his head above water!&rdquo; a voice cried out.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to pull this sleigh out. Keep a stiff
upper lip, Carter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get&mdash;get me out!&rdquo; a voice gasped. &ldquo;I told you
not to let that sleigh go until I told you to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the boys and the coach had arrived
on the spot, and Mac&rsquo;s flashlight showed the scene
before them. One of the sleighs was turned sideways,
and another had run into it and was partly
sunk under the ice. Caught under a runner, and
immersed in water to his chin, was Carter Wolf.
The sleigh had broken the ice, and he had gone in
with a splash. The sleigh runner had pushed in on
top of him and was pressing against his chest,
while his five friends worked frantically to hold
his head above water and at the same time to pull
the winter conveyance back out of the break in the
ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;What happened here?&rdquo; the coach cried, as they
took in the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These f-f-fellows let a sleigh come down the
hill b-be-before I had moved the other one out of
the way,&rdquo; Wolf answered, with chattering teeth.
&ldquo;The ice was thin here and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; In his effort to
talk he slipped slightly and swallowed some icy
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep perfectly still,&rdquo; the athletic coach commanded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you out.&rdquo; He lay down flat on
the ice and passed his gloved hands under Wolf&rsquo;s
armpits, feeling the shock of the cold water. It was
a position of extreme peril for Coach Jordan if
the ice broke away, but he did not allow his mind
to dwell on the thought. &ldquo;Now, the rest of you boys
draw that sleigh up out of the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had followed and now stood on the
shore, silent except for a few low-voiced exclamations,
their faces white as they saw what had happened.
Mac sprang up the bank and pressed his
flashlight into Mrs. Jordan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep this trained on us, please,&rdquo; he requested,
and then he was back with the others, lending a
hand.</p>
<p>The sleigh was a big one and had considerable
weight to it, but by their united efforts they managed
to move it backward. Coach Jordan had considered
using some of the horses, but time was
pressing, and he knew that Wolf must be rescued
as soon as possible. The boys pulled and tugged
steadily, and the sleigh was finally drawn up on
the bank and off of the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, two of you come here!&rdquo; the coach called.
&ldquo;Only two, and come around in a circle back of
me so as not to put too great a strain on the ice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of Wolf&rsquo;s companions quickly and carefully
circled around the gaping hole and made
their way to the coach. His friends were quiet and
obviously frightened by the recent events. Also,
they were quite willing to help, and although
somewhat afraid to trust the ice, they knelt beside
the athletic instructor and helped him lift Carter
Wolf out of the icy waters of Lake Arrowtip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of you boys race to the lodge and get some
blankets,&rdquo; Jordan directed.</p>
<p>Tim started on the jump. &ldquo;Come on, Mac,&rdquo; he
cried, and his brother joined him at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Kent watched them run up the slope toward the
lodge and then turned to look on as Coach Jordan
and Wolf&rsquo;s two friends guided him as he stumbled
toward the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This business is over with, and there is nothing
to worry about on that score,&rdquo; Kent thought.
&ldquo;But Barry is still missing, and if all this excitement
didn&rsquo;t bring him back, there is something decidedly
wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br />At Grips with the Black Shadow</h2>
<p>Unconscious of the events at the lodge, Barry
crouched in the snow at the base of the quarry wall
and gazed in the direction of the shed into which
the figure in black had disappeared. His whole
plan of action had to be changed, and for the time
being he did not know what to do. He had planned
to return to the tool house by way of the tunnel
and tell his friends what he had discovered, but
now it was highly dangerous to go back that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bale of hay sort of slides down on the trapdoor
when you pull it down,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Perhaps
he won&rsquo;t find out that someone has been in the
passageway. I&rsquo;m glad I closed all doors and walls
behind me! But there may be footprints or something
else to give me away. Gosh, this is a tough
situation!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>The man in black was undoubtedly going to the
lodge to start his series of annoyances, and Barry
knew that these things would frighten the girls.
Besides preventing that, he wanted more than anything
else to take this prowler a captive, and if it
was not done tonight, it might never be done. He
fairly groaned as he saw the hopelessness of the
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys may not get him, and if we lose him
this time we&rsquo;re sunk! If I had my hunting rifle I&rsquo;d
go back along the tunnel and call on him to surrender,
but I haven&rsquo;t a thing, and I imagine that
the man is armed or at least able to put up a good
fight. It would be suicide to follow him through
the passageway. But I must get back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were just two ways open to him: through
the underground tunnel or by way of the woods.
Of course the secret passage was the quickest
route, but it was also the most dangerous. Barry
decided not to risk it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take me a little longer to dash through
the woods, but it will be a heap safer,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;If I went through the tunnel and met the spook
face to face, I&rsquo;d never be able to get away, and I&rsquo;ve
simply got to get back and warn the people at the
lodge!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Rising from his stooping position, Barry began
to run toward the shed. He did not like the idea of
having to pass it, for the man might have found
out that someone had been in the passage, and
might have returned to investigate the vicinity of
the quarry. There was a chance that the black
shadow might step out of the shed just as he
passed, and if that happened things would not be
well for the boy. But there was no help for it, and
he sprinted past, glancing sideways in some alarm
and ready to increase his speed if need be. The
door of the shed, however, remained closed, and
no one challenged him as he sped past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; he exulted, as he left the quarry
and plunged into the woods. &ldquo;I made that all right,
and now if I can get to the lodge just about as soon
as he does, everything will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>He did not take the exact path that he and Kent
had taken on the night of the big storm, since they
had gone in a roundabout way, but, relying on
chance, he cut across the timber belt in a straight
line, hoping that he was not making any mistake.
Running was not easy because the snow was loose
and the under snow had melted and then frozen
again, making slippery footing. Occasionally his
foot hit the root of a tree or a stone, and once he
dropped on one knee and only saved himself from
a complete fall by his outflung hands. But he
struggled on, determined to reach the ones in the
lodge as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When he reached the edge of the trees he saw
the man in black sneaking from the tool house
toward the rear porch of the lodge. At the same
time something happened that caused the black
shadow to stop and flatten himself against the wall
of the house and made Barry halt in his run.</p>
<p>There was a sudden stir and some shouts, and
then Coach Jordan and the other boys came running
across the porch and jumped into the snow.
Watching with bewildered eyes, Barry thought
for a moment that they had somehow discovered
the presence of the black shadow, but they did not
come along the side of the lodge building, but
dashed across the snow in the direction of the
Bronson cabin. Barry followed them with his eyes,
and then he noticed that the sleighs were gone.
The situation began to dawn upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has taken the sleighs, and the boys
are after them. Carter Wolf said he was going to
do something to break up our party, and I guess
he&rsquo;ll do it in one way or another. Some of those
sleighs are borrowed, and I hope they don&rsquo;t smash
them up in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered what the man in black would do
and once more looked in his direction. The
prowler had been as completely surprised as Barry
had been, and while the boys were running he remained
perfectly still, pressed close against the
wall. But now he had glided in swift retreat to the
back porch, which afforded more shelter.</p>
<p>There was another exodus from the lodge as the
girls followed the boys, accompanied by the leaping,
barking Castor Oil. Jennie had been feeding
him marshmallows, and he was completely her
slave, so much so that, when Charlie had run out,
his clumsy animal companion had watched him go
without any desire to follow him. He was content
to run with the girls, dashing and barking in a
wild display of good spirits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Barry could hear the girls talking, and he
watched them disappear down the slope that led
from the front of the Bronson cabin to the lake.
Something had happened down there, and he was
anxious to know what it was, but his duty now was
to watch the man who had taken refuge on the
back porch of the hunting lodge. No doubt his
plans had been upset as had Barry&rsquo;s, and it was interesting
to see what he would do under the circumstances.
Would he beat a retreat down the passageway
and be lost to them, Barry wondered? Of
course, if the man did, it would be much safer for
them simply to get some officers of the law up
there and try and trace the tunnel and find out
where the man lived. But the thought did not
satisfy him. He wanted to catch the prowler on the
spot, so that he would have no loophole through
which to escape when accused of causing the disturbances
at Bluff Lodge.</p>
<p>Perhaps the shadow would go back into the tool
house and wait until they got back, so as to produce
rappings and noises. If this was his program,
Barry felt sure that he could tackle the man on the
spot and hold him until help arrived, but he would
want that help to be pretty near at the time. No
doubt the prowler was armed, as anyone engaged
in a desperate business was likely to be, unless he
had scorned to go armed against a group of high-school
boys and girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Barry was not left long in doubt. The man had
hesitated because he had been doing some rapid
thinking, and at last he had made up his mind.
Leaving the back porch, he ran hastily to the
living-room window and peered in. Then he bent
low to escape the light from the fire and the lamps
and passed on to the front, where he crossed the
porch and entered the front door.</p>
<p>Barry guessed his intention at once. The boys
and girls had run out and left many things behind
them, among other things some fairly good coats,
and the pocketbooks of the girls were on the table.
The black shadow had made up his mind to take
them and get away, and perhaps to come back with
his knocking pranks later on. Knowing the lodge
as well as he seemed to, he would no doubt go out
the back as they came in the front. Fate had put
him in position to make a daring and completely
successful raid.</p>
<p>Barry lost no time. Running his best, he left the
timber and cut on a straight line for the lodge. He
did not know what the boys were doing down there
at the lake, and he had no time to go and find out.
It was his supreme chance, and he had the feeling
that if he lost out now, the ghostly prowler of
Bluff Lodge would never be captured. He leaped
to the porch and ran across it into the dark hall
and finally jerked the door to the living room
open, blinking in the light of the lamps as his eyes
swept the interior of the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>The tall man in the black overcoat, hat, and
gloves whirled at the sound of his coming and
turned two burning dark eyes upon him. But if
Barry expected to see his face, he was disappointed.
A black handkerchief obscured all of it
except his eyes, which seemed to glare out above
the covering. He had been feverishly picking up
coats, hats, and pocketbooks and was in the act of
taking a fur piece belonging to Mrs. Jordan when
Barry burst into the room. As the boy faced him
with resolute though pale face, the man pointed a
black-gloved finger at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of here, boy!&rdquo; he cried, hoarsely. &ldquo;Get
out or you&rsquo;ll wish you had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry had made up his mind, on the way, that
talking would be a waste of time. From the moment
that he had opened the door he was preparing
for the struggle that was sure to come. He had
opened his Mackinaw coat while running, and
now he dropped it to the floor behind him. Then,
even while the man was pointing at him, he leaped
across the floor at the black-clad figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>He was tense and his throat was dry as he closed
in on the intruder. His great fear was that the man
would draw a weapon and shoot him down. But
the truth of the matter was that he had engaged
the man at exactly the right time. The outlaw had
his arms full of coats and other things, and as
Barry grappled with him he was vainly trying to
shake a pocketbook loose, the chain of which had
become twisted around his middle finger on his
right hand. This incident, small as it was, gave
Barry a fighting chance.</p>
<p>His arms went around the man, and with a twist
the high-school boy swept his adversary off his
feet. They went down with a resounding crash to
the floor, and the black hat rolled off, revealing a
rather well-shaped head with a high forehead.
The black eyes seemed to look into Barry&rsquo;s face for
an instant in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Then their expression turned to one of deadly
hate, and the battle was on. Only for a moment did
the man accept his quick overthrow. In the twinkling
of an eye he was fighting like a tiger, snarling
exceedingly bad language as his eyes seemed to
shoot out fire. Barry felt the muscles under the
long black overcoat stiffen and become like steel,
and the fingers that began to creep and grope for
his throat were wiry and powerful. Reaching for
one of the man&rsquo;s hands, Barry was tossed forward,
and his arm brushed the black handkerchief from
his face. Only for an instant did he see the features
of his enemy. The man was about forty years old,
with a thin face and small mustache. Just now the
veins on his forehead stood out, and his teeth
showed slightly as he exerted himself to overcome
the mystery hunter.</p>
<p>The man launched a blow at Barry which
caught him off guard and caused him to pause in
his efforts to pin down the hands of the prowler.
The fist of the stranger landed just under Barry&rsquo;s
chin, and in the pain and surprise of it the boy
hesitated. This was just what the man was waiting
for. His long thin legs came up, one of them
hooked over Barry&rsquo;s neck, and a mighty tug sent
the boy tumbling backward. Before the young
mystery hunter could recover, the black shadow
was upon him and strong fingers had gripped his
throat, cutting off his wind instantly. Sudden fire
and aching pain shot through the boy from Cloverfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end!&rdquo; flashed through his bewildered
mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely beaten!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>At that moment the twins came running in to
get a blanket for Carter Wolf. They paused on the
threshold and stared at the scene before them incredulously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br />The Mystery of the Lodge</h2>
<p>The Ford boys stood in the doorway and gazed
at the unexpected sight before them like persons
in a daze. The fingers of the man were clutching
Barry&rsquo;s throat, and one knee was planted with
crushing force on his chest. The face which the
stranger turned toward the twins was dark with
rage and exertion, and his black eyes were fierce
and defiant. So utterly unexpected was this scene
to the two newcomers that they remained rooted
to the spot until a choking cry burst from Barry,
who was looking at them imploringly.</p>
<p>Then Mac suddenly came to life, and a growl
of anger burst from him. &ldquo;Come on, Tim,&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;This man is killing Barry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off!&rdquo; snarled the man, half turning to
face them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away from here, and nobody
is going to stop me! Keep away, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>The last part of his sentence was never finished.
Mac hurled himself on the stranger, jerking his
hands away from Barry&rsquo;s throat. Tim joined him
with vigor, and they fairly tore him off of their
chum. He came up with a spring and wrapped his
arms around the twins, twisting them roughly in
an effort to break away. He realized that others
were coming, and his one desire now was to thrust
them aside and get away.</p>
<p>But the Ford boys had no intention of letting
him go, and even Barry, weak and shaken as he
was, returned to the fight to keep the man from
escaping. Catching him around one leg, Barry
held him tightly while the twins tried to break
loose from his iron grip, at the same time striving
to throw him. Back and forth they swayed and
struggled, panting and straining. The center table
was pushed to one side, and they were up against
a wicker chair when the others came back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>They had been coming along slowly with Carter
Wolf, and could not understand why the twins
did not hasten with the blanket. The lodge
prowler heard them coming, and the perspiration
of a real fear now stood out on his head. Like a
wild animal trapped, he looked around, and just
as the incoming party filled the doorway and
gazed in wonder at the struggle, he drew back his
free foot and prepared to deal Barry a kick that
would free the leg that the boy was holding. He
felt that if he could once get that leg loose he could
drag the twins into the hall leading to the lodge
kitchen and somehow get rid of them.</p>
<p>But in raising his other foot he lost his balance,
and he and the twins went down in a crashing
heap, breaking the wicker chair to bits. Screams
came from the girls, and the coach and Kent
leaped forward to pull the combatants apart. Carter
Wolf forgot his forlorn condition, and his
friends stared in amazement. The coats and
pocketbooks on the floor, the table back against the
wall, and the general signs of confusion put them
all at a loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, what is going on here?&rdquo; Coach Jordan
asked, as he hauled the twins off of the fallen man.
But to his astonishment Kent immediately threw
himself on the stranger, holding his hands out in
front of him by the wrists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get a rope or a curtain cord or something,&rdquo;
Kent commanded, and Tim turned to look for
something. But at the same moment the black
shadow suddenly tried a dash for the hall door.
Instantly all four boys, including the bruised
Barry, leaped at him and bore him to the floor.
The girls again screamed, and the coach looked
bewildered. The captive addressed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call these fool boys off, Jordan! You know
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Barry asked, finding his voice
hoarse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this is Felix Morganson, nephew of the
lady who owns this lodge!&rdquo; was the unexpected
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the mystery hunters, in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, and when my aunt hears of this,
you&rsquo;ll hear a thing or two,&rdquo; said Felix Morganson.
But the boys were not at all worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Kent, warmly. &ldquo;But you
are the ghost of this so-called haunted lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; nodded Barry. &ldquo;I saw him come up
here through a secret underground tunnel, and
when I arrived on the scene in this room he was
stealing our coats and everything else in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; denied the prisoner, his keen eyes
shifting around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, and if we hadn&rsquo;t come along when we
did, you would have just about killed Barry,&rdquo; Mac
declared. By this time Tim had found a rope, and
Kent took it and tried to tie the wrists of the
prisoner behind him. Felix Morganson looked at
the coach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jordan, are you going to stand for this?&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Somebody will get into big trouble, and
you are in charge of these boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach hesitated, plainly at a loss, and Barry
quickly took command of the situation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
right, Mr. Jordan, and I will assume full responsibility.
My father has been trying for a long time
to find the man who has been giving this lodge the
reputation of being haunted, and Mr. Morganson
is the one who did the rapping and thumping. We
must not let him get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the athletic director could speak, there
was a knock on the door of the lodge. They looked
at one another with wondering glances, and then
Charlie Black hurried to the door. One of the girls
swiftly wrapped a blanket around Carter Wolf
and pushed him over in front of the fire. Kent and
Barry kept their eyes on Morganson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Charlie returned with strange companions. Two
men with police stars on their coats came in, driving
the French couple before them. One of the
men held the Frenchman&rsquo;s gun in the crook of his
arm. Pierre and his wife looked sullen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evening, folks!&rdquo; nodded the stouter of the two
men. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sheriff Paulson, and this is McHenry.
We&rsquo;ve been keepin&rsquo; watch on these Frenchies for
a few days, and just now they was outside of this
window, gettin&rsquo; ready to shoot the lamps out.&rdquo; He
looked at Felix Morganson with interest. &ldquo;So here
you are, Mr. Morganson! You ain&rsquo;t in Canada or
South America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s been here all along, Sheriff,&rdquo;
Barry spoke up. &ldquo;I found a secret tunnel from that
quarry over there to the tool house out back. He is
the one who has been giving the place a bad
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found a tunnel, did you?&rdquo; the sheriff asked,
looking at Barry with interest. &ldquo;There used to be
some counterfeiters operating around here, in an
old cabin that stood where this lodge is, and I
guess they was the ones used it. So Mr. Morganson
has been hauntin&rsquo; his own aunt&rsquo;s property! These
Frenchies have been helpin&rsquo; him right along, and
I guess squeezin&rsquo; plenty of money out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Barry suddenly remembered something.
&ldquo;Which one of you shot at Wolf and his friends
the night they sat on the front porch?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try scare heem away,&rdquo; the Frenchman admitted.</p>
<p>After some further conversation the sheriff
agreed to take Morganson to his aunt in Cloverfield.
The would-be ghost of the lodge insisted
upon seeing her, and so at last he and his French
allies went off with the two county officials. Jordan,
Bill Jefferson, and Tom Bailey hitched up a
sleigh and drove them to Fox Point, where the
sheriff took Morganson and the woodsman and his
wife on to Cloverfield in his own conveyance.</p>
<p>The boys from Rake Island did not stay long
after the sheriff left. Carter Wolf thanked everybody
with averted eyes and went off with his
friends, who dragged the sleighs back to the lake
bank before disappearing. In the morning it was
an easy task for the boys to pull them on up the
slope and hitch up the horses.</p>
<p>Barry was somewhat mussed up and quite sore,
but he was the hero of the hour. They sat around
the living-room fire and listened with rapt attention
while he told of his trip along the tunnel, and
when Coach Jordan and the others came back, it
had to be told all over again. They sat up until late
in the night excitedly discussing the events of the
evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we still do not know why Morganson pretended
to be kidnaped and then hung around
haunting the place,&rdquo; Tim reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea, from some things that he admitted
to Sheriff Paulson, that he did it to knock
down the value of the place and buy it from his
aunt for a mere song,&rdquo; spoke up the coach. &ldquo;He always
had a perfect passion for the lodge and was
determined to have it by fair means or foul. I believe
that he was trying to buy it through Brand
Curry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this Coach Jordan was correct. Felix Morganson
had always had a great longing to own
Bluff Lodge, and with Brand Curry and his
French friends he had planned to ruin the reputation
of the place and have his friend buy it very
cheaply. Until Mrs. Morganson died, Brand
Curry would continue to own the property, as far
as outward appearances were concerned, and then
Felix would take it over when his indulgent aunt
passed away. So he had acted a false kidnaping
part and had lived in a small cabin down in the
hollow of a mountain spur close to the abandoned
quarry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>With the capture of Felix Morganson, all mysteries
were cleared up. He was the one who had
taken their sled and who had dropped the snow
behind the chimney upstairs in the hunting lodge.
Having a key to the lodge, he entered it at will.
The Frenchman and his wife had been writing to
him for money, and as he did not send them any,
they came in person to collect it and he joined
them at Fox Point. Officers of the law had become
suspicious and had trailed the French couple.</p>
<p>The young people at the lodge were eager to explore
the counterfeiters&rsquo; tunnel that night, but
Barry persuaded them to wait until the following
day, and they finally consented. Early the next
morning they traversed it and enjoyed the experience.
When the story finally got out, many came
to see it.</p>
<p>Felix Morganson had an interview with his
aunt, and the general opinion was that she was too
easy with him, for he disappeared shortly afterward,
and no charges of any kind were ever placed
against him. The French couple also vanished and
were never seen in that part of the country again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>When the young people from the Cloverfield
High School drove away from Bluff Lodge on the
morning after the capture of the black shadow,
they all agreed that it had been an exciting and enjoyable
straw ride. Barry, Mac, Pearl, and
Charlie rode on the foremost sleigh, and Kent and
the twins were directly behind them. Castor Oil
still clung to the girl who had satisfied his sweet
tooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you boys have certainly earned the name
of &lsquo;mystery hunters,&rsquo;&rdquo; Pearl said, as the sleigh
glided on toward home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all proud of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac grinned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve passed our first test in
mysteries! Wait until the next one comes along!&rdquo;
Just as the sleigh entered the timber, Barry
turned to look back at the log building. &ldquo;So long,
old haunted lodge!&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;You are going to
be mighty lonesome for your friend the black
shadow!&rdquo;</p>
